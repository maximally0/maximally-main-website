        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">💡 What Is a Pitch?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">A pitch is simply telling people what you do or believe—in a way that makes them care.</p>
        <p>You might pitch:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>A startup idea at a hackathon</li>
          <li>Your club to school administrators</li>
          <li>A project to investors or mentors</li>
          <li>Yourself in a college interview</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">In every case, the goal is the same: Get people interested, inspired, and excited to say yes.</p>
        <div className="pixel-border p-6 bg-maximally-purple/5">
          <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">Why It Matters Now:</h3>
          <p>Even if you're not planning a startup, pitching helps you:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Improve public speaking</li>
            <li>Think clearly under pressure</li>
            <li>Stand out in college and job applications</li>
            <li>Build confidence in any situation</li>
          </ul>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">🧠 Step 1: Know Your "Why"</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Before you write a single line of your pitch, answer this:</p>
        <p className="font-bold mb-4">Why does this idea matter to YOU?</p>
        <p className="mb-4">People don't buy into facts. They buy into stories and passion. Start with your motivation—what inspired this idea or project?</p>
        <div className="pixel-border p-6">
          <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">Example:</h3>
          <p className="mb-2">Instead of saying:</p>
          <p className="italic mb-4">"We built a note-sharing app for students."</p>
          <p className="mb-2">Say:</p>
          <p className="italic">"As students, we often struggle to keep up with classes. I missed a week due to illness and fell behind. That's when I thought—what if there was a way for students to help each other catch up easily?"</p>

        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">✍️ Step 2: Craft Your Core Message</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">A great first pitch answers three things clearly:</p>
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mb-6">
          <div className="pixel-border p-4">

        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">⏱️ Step 3: Time It Right</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Your first pitch should be 2–3 minutes max. That's about 300–400 words. You don't need to explain every detail—just give them a taste that leaves them wanting more.</p>

          <ul className="list-none space-y-2">
            <li>• Hook (30 sec): Grab attention with a story or stat</li>
            <li>• Problem (30 sec): Explain the pain point</li>
            <li>• Solution (45 sec): Share your product, service, or idea</li>
            <li>• Why You (30 sec): Show your passion or team advantage</li>

        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">🎤 Step 4: Practice Like a Pro</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Practicing your first pitch doesn't mean memorizing it word-for-word. It means:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Knowing your key points cold</li>
          <li>Practicing in front of a mirror, camera, or friends</li>
          <li>Timing yourself to stay on track</li>
          <li>Recording and rewatching to spot nervous habits</li>
        </ul>
        <div className="bg-maximally-blue/5 p-4 rounded">
          <p className="font-bold">Pro Tip:</p>
          <p>Practice in front of someone who doesn't know your idea. If they "get it" by the end, you're on the right track.</p>
