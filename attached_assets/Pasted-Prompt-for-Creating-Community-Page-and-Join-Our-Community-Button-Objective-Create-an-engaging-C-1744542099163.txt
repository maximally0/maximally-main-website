Prompt for Creating Community Page and "Join Our Community" Button

Objective:

Create an engaging Community page.

Add a Join Our Community button on the homepage.

Make the Community page a central hub for joining different platforms (Instagram, WhatsApp, Discord), receiving updates, and exploring opportunities.

1. Community Page Creation
Page Purpose: The Community page will serve as a central place where users can join various community platforms, get updates, and access exclusive opportunities (e.g., free sessions, job opportunities, etc.).

Page Structure:

Introduction:

Short, engaging text explaining the value of being part of the community.

Mention that by joining the community, users will:

Stay updated with exclusive content.

Gain access to free sessions, webinars, and workshops.

Be notified of career opportunities and collaborations.

Platform Join Links:

Instagram: Provide a link to the company’s Instagram community page with a call-to-action (e.g., “Join our community of passionate learners on Instagram!”).

WhatsApp Group: Provide a link to the WhatsApp group with a call-to-action (e.g., “Join our WhatsApp group for real-time updates and discussions!”).

Discord Server: Provide a link to the Discord server with a call-to-action (e.g., “Join our Discord for interactive discussions, networking, and events!”).

Benefits Section:

Add a section that outlines the benefits of joining the community. For example:

Free Sessions & Webinars: “Get access to free sessions on entrepreneurship, public speaking, digital marketing, and more.”

Exclusive Job Opportunities: “Be the first to know about job and internship opportunities from our partners.”

Networking and Support: “Connect with like-minded individuals who share your passion for growth.”

Event Alerts: “Receive notifications for upcoming bootcamps, workshops, and events.”

Engaging Features:

Consider adding small testimonials or quotes from people who have benefited from being part of the community (if available).

Use call-to-action buttons that stand out, guiding visitors to the platforms they can join (Instagram, WhatsApp, Discord).

Add any other relevant links like a newsletter sign-up or upcoming events calendar (if applicable).

Design & Layout:

Keep the design consistent with the website theme (minimalistic, pixel-art, and modern SaaS style).

Include large, bold headers and minimal text to keep it clear and concise.

Utilize background color contrast or slight animations to make the page feel dynamic but not overwhelming.

Use icons next to the platform names (e.g., Instagram logo, WhatsApp logo, Discord logo) to make it visually engaging.

2. Add "Join Our Community" Button on Homepage
Button Placement: Add the “Join Our Community” button next to the Start Learning button on the homepage.

Button Design:

The button should be black and white (following the theme) to stand out while maintaining the website’s aesthetic.

The button should be large enough to grab attention without overwhelming the page.

When hovered over, it can transition into an electric blue color (consistent with your theme) to show interaction.

Button Functionality: When clicked, the button should redirect users to the newly created /community page.

3. Summary
Objective: The Community page should serve as an engaging, informative space where users can easily join the community on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Discord, while learning about the benefits they will get from being a part of it (updates, free sessions, job opportunities, etc.).

Design: Follow the visual style of the website and ensure it remains clean and minimalistic, with some interactive elements like buttons that change on hover.
