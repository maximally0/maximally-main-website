# Maximally - Global Hackathon League for Teen Builders

## Overview

Maximally is the boldest hackathon ecosystem for teen founders, coders, and creators worldwide. Born in India but built for the world, we host high-stakes innovation events, chaos sprints, and public launch challenges designed for ambitious teenagers (ages 13-19). The platform focuses exclusively on hackathons and innovation competitions - no lectures, no theory, just real proof-of-work events.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Monolith Architecture
The application follows a modern full-stack monolith approach with clear separation between client and server components:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Replit with autoscale configuration

### Technology Stack Rationale
- **Vite over Create React App**: Chosen for faster development builds and better performance
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database interactions with excellent TypeScript integration
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for scalability without infrastructure management
- **ESM Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system for better tree-shaking and performance

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui for accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system featuring "maximally" brand colors
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: React Router for client-side navigation
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **SEO**: React Helmet for dynamic meta tags and structured data

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface supporting both memory and database implementations
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Development Mode**: Vite middleware integration for hot reloading
- **Production Build**: ESBuild for server bundling with external packages

### Design System
- **Typography**: Custom pixel fonts (Press Start 2P, VT323, JetBrains Mono)
- **Color Palette**: Brand colors including maximally-red, maximally-blue, maximally-green
- **Animations**: Custom CSS animations for floating elements and glowing effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly interfaces

## Data Flow

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: Landing page with SEO-optimized content and clear value proposition
2. **Application**: Tally form integration for event applications
3. **Community**: Discord integration for ongoing engagement
4. **Content**: Blog system with detailed guides and success stories

### Content Management

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with autoscale deployment
- **Build Process**: 
  - Frontend: Vite build outputs to `dist/public`
  - Backend: ESBuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL and other secrets managed through Replit secrets
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000 mapped to external port 80

### Development Workflow
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite middleware integration for instant updates
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Development Server**: tsx for TypeScript execution without compilation

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL scales automatically
- **Static Assets**: Served efficiently through Vite's optimized build process
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for horizontal scaling
