              The internet was built on protocols. They're the silent rules that let billions of devices talk, exchange data, and build the digital universe we live in. But what happens when someone bends those rules—or worse, breaks them?
            </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          That's where Protocol 404 sneaks in.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          No, it's not the "Page Not Found" error you bump into daily. Think of Protocol 404 as the glitch in the system that hackers exploit—a mix of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and loopholes that shouldn't exist but do. And if you've ever wondered how cybercriminals can take down systems that cost millions to build, this is usually the backdoor.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Exactly Is Protocol 404?</h2>
        <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 mb-6">
          <p className="font-bold">In simple terms:</p>
          <p>Protocol 404 is not an official standard. It's a slang term floating around hacker forums for protocol-level exploits that rely on broken trust.</p>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Imagine two servers "shaking hands" to exchange information. If the handshake isn't properly checked, an attacker can jump in, impersonate one side, and trick the other. This is where Protocol 404 thrives—it abuses gaps in validation and communication.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Some call it the "invisible exploit layer." Others just call it sloppy engineering.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Hackers Use It</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Hackers love Protocol 404 because it's:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Stealthy</strong> – It hides in the flow of legit traffic. No red flags unless you're really watching.</li>
          <li><strong>Cheap</strong> – Doesn't need zero-days or supercomputers. A few scripts can do the job.</li>
          <li><strong>Universal</strong> – Works across apps, networks, even IoT devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">Examples of how it shows up:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Tricking a system into believing the attacker is a verified user.</li>
          <li><strong>Downgrade Attacks:</strong> Forcing a system to use weaker protocols (like HTTP instead of HTTPS).</li>
          <li><strong>Misrouted Data Packets:</strong> Redirecting information through malicious servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Think of it like finding a crack in a dam. One crack isn't a disaster. But if you know where to push, the whole thing can collapse.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why It Matters Today</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With AI, IoT, and billions of APIs running everything from banking to healthcare, protocol-level trust is the backbone of our digital world.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">If Protocol 404-style exploits go unchecked:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Medical devices can be spoofed.</li>
          <li>Banking systems can be redirected.</li>
          <li>Cloud services can be hijacked.</li>
          <li>Hackathons and startups can lose credibility overnight.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's not just about security. It's about digital trust itself.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Defense Playbook</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The good news? Just because hackers love Protocol 404 doesn't mean developers are helpless. Here's how to keep your systems clean:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <ul className="space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Enforce Strong Handshakes</strong> – Use TLS 1.3, drop outdated protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Anomalies</strong> – Traffic that looks normal but behaves weirdly is a red flag.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Trust Architecture</strong> – Never assume a handshake means safety. Always verify.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Patching</strong> – Old misconfigurations are Protocol 404's playground.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Protocol 404 is a reminder: The weakest link in the system isn't always code—it's trust.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Hackers don't need to invent new exploits when they can ride broken protocols into your system. That's why developers, security engineers, and even hackathon teams need to build with resilience-first thinking.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white p-6 rounded-lg text-center">
          <p className="text-lg font-bold">
            Because in the end, Protocol 404 isn't about technology failing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold mt-2">
            It's about us forgetting that every digital handshake needs a bodyguard.
          </p>
            </div>
          </>
        }
