              Every once in a while, the tech world gets shaken up by something that feels less like an update—and more like a revolution. That's what Protocol 404 is shaping up to be.
            </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Most people hear "404" and instantly think of an error page. But here, it's not about something missing—it's about something emerging. Protocol 404 is not just a concept; it's a movement redefining how hackathons are run, how teams collaborate, and how innovation gets discovered.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Protocol 404 Matters</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Hackathons have always been about rapid building, late nights, and wild ideas. But let's be real: they've also had problems. Limited inclusivity, over-engineering, networking silos, and burnouts often kill the real essence of creating.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">Protocol 404 flips the script. Instead of chasing buzzwords, it focuses on community-first innovation. Think of it as a system where:</p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <ul className="space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Participation is asynchronous</strong> → You don't need to be online at 3 AM to prove you're "committed."</li>
            <li><strong>Contributions are modular</strong> → Small, smart, incremental pushes matter as much as flashy demos.</li>
            <li><strong>Recognition is transparent</strong> → Effort is visible, not just the final presentation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          It's like the hackathon format finally caught up with the world we actually live in.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">From Error Code to Evolution</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The symbolism is beautiful. A "404 Not Found" has always been frustrating. Now, Protocol 404 reclaims it—saying:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-maximally-red text-white p-6 rounded-lg mb-6 text-center">
          <p className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">
            What if what you couldn't find before… now exists?
          </p>
        </div>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Can't find genuine collaboration? → Here's a framework that encourages it.</li>
          <li>Can't find diversity in ideas? → Here's a format that makes space for everyone.</li>
          <li>Can't find meaning beyond prizes? → Here's a culture that values growth.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This isn't just semantics. It's culture-hacking.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Maximally Connection</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At Maximally, Protocol 404 isn't theory—it's practice. The idea is already shaping The Great Indian Hackathon Season, turning hackathons into global-scale experiences where learning, building, and belonging intersect.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Instead of coding marathons ending in exhaustion, participants are guided into creating projects that live beyond the event. Mentorship, feedback loops, and a community that stays active post-hackathon—that's where Protocol 404 is different.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Who Wins in a Protocol 404 World?</h2>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-6">
          <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="font-bold text-green-800 mb-2">Students & Beginners</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-green-700">No longer filtered out by lack of resources or timezone issues.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6 text-center font-bold text-lg">
          In short: everyone.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thought</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Protocol 404 is proof that innovation isn't just about code—it's about the protocols we live by. By changing how we build together, it changes what gets built.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-900 text-white p-6 rounded-lg text-center">
          <p className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">
            Next time you hear "404 Not Found," smile.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Because in this new world, what we couldn't find before—collaboration, accessibility, real creativity—is finally here.
          </p>
            </div>
          </>
        }
