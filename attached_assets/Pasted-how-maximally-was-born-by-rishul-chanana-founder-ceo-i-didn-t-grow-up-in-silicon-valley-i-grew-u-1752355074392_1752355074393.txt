how maximally was born
by rishul chanana, founder & ceo

i didn’t grow up in silicon valley
i grew up in zirakpur
no startup dads
no hack clubs
just a laptop, a messy brain, and a stupid amount of ambition

i started alone
no cofounder, no mentor, no team — just vibes and hunger

the first version of maximally?
wasn’t even about hackathons
it was a probiotic brand
(i thought gen z gut health was the next big thing)

then came skincare
(i was convinced we could build india’s version of glossier)

both flopped.
but those experiments taught me something:
i didn’t care about the product
i cared about building with people

i wasn’t in love with D2C
i was in love with chaos
with ideas
with execution

finding home in hackathons
i was never the most technical guy
not the best coder
not a deck-polisher either

but i could do something weirdly valuable —
translate between vision and execution
between pitch decks and github repos

and hackathons?
they were the only place that made me feel seen
where strangers became teammates at 2am
where we built things that didn’t make sense
and still walked away proud

in class 9, i joined my first hackathon
in class 10, i hosted one at school
in class 11, i co-founded CodeQuest with yash
(which later became north india’s biggest school hackathon, HackSkye)

somewhere along that path
i realized i wasn’t just organizing events
i was building a culture

so what is maximally?
maximally isn’t just a hackathon company
it’s not bootcamps
not a discord server
not devpost spam

it’s a system for young, hungry, slightly chaotic builders
who don’t fit into IIT or VC paths
but still want to ship things that matter

we started with 7-day bootcamps
then added makeathons, wild formats, and media storytelling
today, we run:

startup makeathons

ai shipathons

brand-a-thons & design sprints

chaotic side quests like scrapyard showdown & clout court

maximally studios for reels, founder docs, & storytelling

a growing community on discord, instagram, linkedin, and devpost

but under all of that, it’s still one thing:
a place where execution is culture

who is it for?
we don’t care about your age
we don’t care if you can’t code
we don’t care if you’ve never pitched in your life

if you have a laptop, internet, and imagination
you’re welcome here

this is for the people who feel too weird for school
too early for startup land
too chaotic for structure
but still want to build, learn, and ship something that feels real

maximally supports vision
maximally supports delusion
maximally supports people who aren’t “ready” — but are still showing up anyway

what we're actually building
we’re not just running events
we’re building a new launchpad for innovation
outside of silicon valley
outside of age
outside of gatekeeping

our long-term vision:

a global league of gen z builders

a new education system based on proof-of-work

a platform where your first MVP gets more respect than your grades

maximally is meant to be:

the harvard for high-agency dropouts

the yc for gen z founders

the red bull of the startup world
except built in india
by kids
for kids who feel like they don’t belong anywhere else

and me?
i started maximally at 16
with zero money
no credibility
just vibes and momentum

now it’s real
real events
real stories
real mentors
real friends
real execution

we’re not done
we’re not even close

we’re just getting started
