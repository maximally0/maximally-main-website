Got you — here’s a **clean, developer-ready write-up** that tells your designer to build a **Maximally landing page inspired by Unstop’s UI**, but with your own *builder-first*, *hackathon-energy*, *cleaner*, *bolder* version of it.

This is NOT a clone.
This is a **reinterpretation** of Unstop’s structure, layout logic, and UX patterns — but in Maximally’s identity.

Copy-paste this to your developer/designer.

# 🚀 **PROMPT FOR DEVELOPER — MAXIMALLY LANDING PAGE (UNSTOP-STYLE, OUR VERSION)**

We’re redesigning the Maximally landing page using **Unstop’s UI structure and UX patterns**, but adapted to our brand.

Unstop is a general opportunity portal.
Maximally is a **tech + builders-only opportunity platform**.
So the layout should feel familiar like Unstop, but visually sharper, simpler, more modern, and more “builder/hacker” oriented.

The design direction:

* Clean like Unstop
* Sections arranged like Unstop
* But visually more premium, more minimal, darker, and more tech-forward
* Absolutely ZERO copying of Unstop graphics or text — only the *structure* and *workflow style*

# 🧩 **OVERALL STYLE (VERY IMPORTANT)**

### **Think:**

Unstop’s clarity + navigation
Replit’s hacker aesthetic
Figma’s spacing + typography
MLH’s energy
Maximally brand identity

### Core design traits:

* Light mode or light-gray mode (not fully dark) like Unstop
* White, grayscale, subtle gradients
* No loud backgrounds
* Simple iconography
* High contrast
* Big, readable typography
* Category chips + horizontal scroll sections
* Card-based UI everywhere
* Very “clean professional product” look

# 🧱 **STRUCTURE (FOLLOW UNSTOP'S FLOW, BUT OUR CONTENT)**

Use Unstop's UX layout logic:

## **1. Top Navbar**

Unstop-like:
Left = logo
Right = Explore Opportunities | Categories | Community | For Organizers | Login | Sign Up

Flat, clean, white background, slight shadow.

---

## **2. Hero Section (Unstop-style)**

Unstop has a main hero with illustration + search.

We want our version:

**Left Side (text):**

* Big headline: “the opportunity platform for young builders”
* Subtext: “find hackathons, accelerators, fellowships, competitions, gigs, and more — built for developers, founders, and creators.”
* Two main buttons: Explore opportunities / List your program

**Right Side:**
Instead of an illustration, use a card-wall or modular tech shapes.
Light, minimal, but energetic — NOT cartoonish.

---

## **3. Search Bar (like Unstop)**

Centered under hero.
Wide, rounded search bar for:
“Search hackathons, fellowships, accelerators…”

Below it, category chips (scrollable on mobile).

---

## **4. Category Grid (Influenced by Unstop’s category blocks)**

9 categories:

* Hackathons
* Startup Competitions
* AI & Tech Challenges
* Fellowships
* Accelerators
* Bootcamps
* Grants & Funding
* Internships & Startup Gigs
* Workshops & Events

Each category = card with:

* minimal icon
* name
* small description
* Unstop-style light-gray card with subtle hover

---

## **5. Featured Opportunities Section (Unstop-style carousels)**

Use **horizontal scroll carousels** just like Unstop:

* Trending Now
* Closing Soon
* Popular This Week

Each card includes:

* logo / thumbnail
* category tag
* title
* organizer
* deadline
* register button

Cards should be lighter and sharper; no clutter.

---

## **6. Filter Bar (Unstop’s filter pattern)**

Below featured opportunities, add an “Explore All Opportunities” section with a filter bar:

* Category
* Difficulty
* Prize
* Online/Offline
* Tags

Clean dropdowns + chip filters like Unstop.

---

## **7. Info Blocks / Value Proposition**

This replaces Unstop’s “Why Choose Us” section.

3-column layout:

1. discover in one place
2. register once, apply everywhere
3. run programs with zero setup

Use minimal vector icons.

---

## **8. Ecosystem Section (Unstop has similar partner/solution sections)**

Cards for:

* Maximally Events
* Maximally Community
* Federation
* Mentor Network
* Micro-challenges
* Maximally Fund

Grid of simple cards like Unstop's “Solutions” layout.

---

## **9. Trust Section (Unstop has big logos area)**

Logos of:
Google, Microsoft, Meta, McKinsey, Visa, Replit, Atlassian, FedEx, Amazon.

Use Unstop’s grid layout style but with Maximally branding.

---

## **10. For Organizers (Match Unstop’s “For Recruiters” blocks)**

Simple two-card layout:

* Build your microsite
* Manage registrations and analytics

Each with icon, short description, clean card UI.

---

## **11. Dual CTA Section (Unstop often has stacked CTAs)**

Two blocks:

**Left Card:**
For Builders
Button: Browse opportunities

**Right Card:**
For Organizers
Button: List your program

Same sizing & spacing concepts as Unstop.

---

## **12. Footer (Use Unstop’s structured footer style)**

4-column structure:

* Opportunities
* For Organizers
* Company
* Social

White background, thin dividers, small text.

---

# 🎨 **VISUAL GUIDELINES (MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A PREMIUM VERSION OF UNSTOP)**

If you want, I can make:

Just say the word.
