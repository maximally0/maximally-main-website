## 🔧 `/bootcamps` Page Revamp — FINAL PROMPT FOR DEV

Hey! Here's a full breakdown of all the changes we want on the `/bootcamps` page. Please **don’t remove any core structure** unless specified. Focus on **reordering, adding sections, enhancing visuals**, and making the text look super attractive (Gen-Z/Minecraft/SaaS aesthetic).

---

### ✅ **1. Reorder Sections (Final Flow)**

Please re-arrange sections of the page as follows:

**New Section Order:**

1. Hero Banner (retain existing but change background to solid white)
2. ✅ “Accepted? You're In For Life” (move this **just below the Apply button**)
3. 🎁 Perks & Alumni Privileges
4. 👥 Who Should Apply
5. 📍 Application Roadmap (New)
6. 📚 Curriculum (make this dropdown-style)
7. ❓ FAQs (New)
8. ⏳ Countdown Timer (floating or fixed on page)
9. Apply Now button (can repeat somewhere mid-page too)

---

### 🎨 **2. Hero Banner Enhancements**

**Background:** Make the hero section background **solid white** (no gradient or dynamic image).

**Text Styling:** Make it pop. Add color highlights to important phrases using Maximally brand colors (red, blue, black). Example:  
- Highlight **"Our most ambitious teens"**, **"Only 200 students"**, **"Certificate of Excellence"**, and **"You're in for life"** with bold color styling.

**Text content (unchanged, but styled better):**
```
Our most ambitious teens join us this summer. Will you?

Only 200 students get accepted into our certificate of excellence program. Once you're in for life.
```

---

### 🏆 **3. Accepted? You're In For Life Section (MOVE UP)**

**Move this entire block to just after the Hero section and Apply button.**

Use a clean block format with each benefit clearly broken out with an icon or emoji.

Text to display:
```
🏆 Accepted? You're In for Life  
Your badge of honor in the digital age  

🎓 Certificate of Excellence

Use cards or columns to display each perk with a cool icon and clean formatting.

Text:
```

Add a new accordion-style FAQ block toward the bottom of the page, before the final Apply button.

```

### ⏳ **9. Countdown Timer (NEW Sticky Block)**

### 🪄 FINAL STYLE NOTES

- Stick to **solid colors** — no gradients or blurred/floating backgrounds. White/light backgrounds preferred for clarity.
- Use **Maximally brand colors**: red, blue, black.
- Keep everything **Gen-Z friendly**: big headings, emojis/icons, bold text, interactive components.
- Don't change any text content without approval. Just style and position better.
- Prioritize legibility and clean spacing over cramming.
