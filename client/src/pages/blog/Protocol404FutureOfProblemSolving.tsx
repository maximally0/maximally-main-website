              We've all faced errors while coding. But what if an error wasn't just a bug‚Ä¶ but a way of thinking? That's exactly what Protocol 404 represents at Maximally.
            </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At first glance, it reminds you of the infamous HTTP 404 ‚Äì Page Not Found. But here, it's less about a broken link and more about breaking limitations. It's about creating a mindset where failure isn't the end‚Äîit's just the start of innovation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Idea Behind Protocol 404</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Every coder, designer, or hacker has hit a wall‚Äîwhether it's a missing resource, a tool that doesn't exist yet, or an idea that feels too big to build.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">Instead of stopping at the error, Protocol 404 pushes you to ask:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>What if this "not found" becomes the reason I build something new?</li>
          <li>What if my missing resource is actually my biggest opportunity?</li>
          <li>What if innovation begins exactly where traditional solutions fail?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          That's the Protocol 404 philosophy‚Äîa hacker's way of thinking where failure ‚â† dead end.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Protocol 404 Matters in Hackathons</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Hackathons thrive on uncertainty. You walk in with limited time, resources, and endless problems. The real challenge isn't just coding‚Äîit's figuring out what to do when something doesn't exist.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">That's where Protocol 404 kicks in:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>üõ† Creativity under pressure ‚Üí No solution? Build your own.</li>
          <li>‚è≥ Adaptability ‚Üí Time's running out, but you learn to pivot fast.</li>
          <li>üí° Innovation-first mindset ‚Üí Instead of patching errors, you design fresh paths.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          At Maximally, we don't see 404 as an error. We see it as a signal to innovate.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Protocol 404 and The Great Indian Hackathon</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In our upcoming Great Indian Hackathon Season, Protocol 404 isn't just a theme‚Äîit's a culture. Participants will face challenges that don't have ready-made answers. The ones who succeed won't be those who avoid errors but those who turn errors into experiments.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">Imagine this:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>A team tries to connect APIs that don't exist ‚Üí they end up building their own.</li>
          <li>Someone struggles with limited datasets ‚Üí they generate synthetic ones.</li>
          <li>A "missing page" becomes the first chapter of a new project.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          That's Protocol 404 in action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">From Error to Evolution</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you adopt Protocol 404, every bug, crash, or missing link becomes a spark for progress. It transforms the way you look at problems‚Äînot as blockers, but as gateways to innovation.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6 text-center">
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800">
            The next time you see a 404 error, remember:
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl font-bold text-maximally-red mt-2">
            Page Not Found ‚Üí Possibility Found
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Protocol 404 is more than a theme‚Äîit's a mindset shift. It's about creating builders who don't wait for solutions but become the solution.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">So, as you step into Maximally's hackathons, ask yourself:</p>
        <div className="bg-maximally-blue text-white p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-center">
            "What's my 404 today?"
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-bold text-center mt-2">
            "And how can I turn it into my next big breakthrough?"
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Because at the end of the day, every 'Not Found' is just waiting to be Found by You.
            </p>
          </>
        }
      />
    </>
  );
