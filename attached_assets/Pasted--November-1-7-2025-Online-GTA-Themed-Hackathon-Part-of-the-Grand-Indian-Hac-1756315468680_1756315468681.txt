📅 **November 1–7, 2025** | 🌍 **Online** | 🎨 GTA-Themed Hackathon

*Part of the Grand Indian Hackathon Season*

---

## 🎮 WHAT IS GRAND TECH ASSEMBLY?

A 7-day global online hackathon styled after the nostalgia and chaos of **Grand Theft Auto**.

Not crime — but **missions, respect, and chaos**.

- Pick your mission (track)
- Build your city (project)
- Earn respect (awards + prizes)

---

## 🧠 THE IDEA

*"If hackathons were an open-world game, what would you build?"*

This is a **sandbox hackathon**.

- No fixed theme, only **missions** and **side quests**.
- Every project = a story in the GTA: Maximally “city.”
- The vibe = **chaotic, nostalgic, and beginner-friendly**.
