What is Maximally Hacktober?

Most hackathons want speed. Hacktober gives you time. A full 31 days to stick with one idea, through burnout, late nights, sparks of momentum. It’s about finishing what you started — or finally building what you said you would.

Theme

Build Through the Fall

October isn’t about polish, it’s about process. Ideas can crumble like autumn leaves and still be beautiful. Fix an abandoned project, start a wild experiment, or just finish something — Hacktober is your season.

Visual Tone

Burnt orange, dark coffee, cream beige, faded red, midnight purple

Icons: maple leaves, floppy disks, crescent moons, retro code

Mood: journaling next to a campfire after a long build
