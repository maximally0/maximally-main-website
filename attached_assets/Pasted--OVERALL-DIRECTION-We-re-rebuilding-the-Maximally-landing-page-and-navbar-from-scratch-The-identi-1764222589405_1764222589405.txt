⭐ OVERALL DIRECTION

We’re rebuilding the Maximally landing page and navbar from scratch.
The identity is:

Hackathon-first, consumer-first, clean, expandable, with a cosmic/neon hacker aesthetic.

The site must look good TODAY with limited content, but also be able to scale when we add more initiatives later (jobs, labs, fellowships, projects, tools, etc).

No clutter. No messy dropdowns. No over-complication.

⭐ NEW NAVBAR (FINAL STRUCTURE)

Navbar Items:

Home

Hackathons

Organizers

Explore ← this is the master bucket for everything else

About

Right-side CTA: Join a Hackathon

Notes:

Keep it minimal and clean

No dropdowns needed for now (but allow future dropdown later)

“Explore” will link to a page that hosts all other categories

⭐ LANDING PAGE — FINAL SECTION ORDER

Please follow this order exactly — do NOT rearrange:

Hero

Credibility

Happening Now

Upcoming Hackathons

Explore Maximally (expandable cards section)

Why Maximally

For Organizers

Partners

Footer

This structure is designed to be consumer-first + future-proof.

⭐ SECTION-BY-SECTION DETAILS + REQUIRED COPY
1. HERO

Big headline: “Welcome to the Hackathon Universe.”

Subheading:
High-energy hackathons and programs for ambitious builders. Discover events, join challenges, and explore everything Maximally has to offer.

Buttons:

Explore Hackathons (primary)

Explore Everything (secondary)

Design:

Dark theme

Neon/cosmic gradients

Subtle particle background

Clean, not cartoonish

No heavy animations

2. CREDIBILITY

Place directly under the hero.

Content:

15,000+ participants

11+ flagship hackathons

20+ sponsor partners

Judges from Google, Microsoft, Meta, AWS

Events with schools, colleges, communities, startups

Include a simple logo strip of key partners/judges.

3. HAPPENING NOW

A dynamic section for 1–3 cards.

Card types:

Featured Hackathon

Closing Soon

Newly Announced

This must be data-driven, not hardcoded, so we can update it easily.

4. UPCOMING HACKATHONS (CORE SECTION)

Show all upcoming events in a grid.

Hackathon Card should include:

Name

Theme

Dates

Prize

Poster

Register button

Tags (online/offline/beginner/etc)

Button: View All Hackathons

This is the biggest and most important section.

5. EXPLORE MAXIMALLY (EXPANDABLE)

This is the MOST IMPORTANT SCALABLE SECTION.

Title:
Explore Maximally

Sub:
All the other things we’re building around the hackathon ecosystem.

TODAY’s cards (start with these):

Jobs & Internships (curated opportunities)

Work With Us (task force, team roles)

FUTURE cards (must be easy to add):

Labs

Startup Gigs

Fellowships

Competitions

Special Projects

Tools

Resources

MFHOP

Judging

Community

This entire section must be able to expand from 2 cards to 10+ later WITHOUT redesigning the grid.

Use a uniform card component.

6. WHY MAXIMALLY

Short punchy reasons:

Creative, themed hackathons

High-energy formats

Beginner-friendly

Real judges & real feedback

Thriving builder community

Innovation-first approach

One-line punchline:
We make building fun, competitive, and meaningful.

7. FOR ORGANIZERS

Small clean section.

Cards:

Join MFHOP

Judges & Mentors Access

CTA: Learn More

8. PARTNERS

Simple logo bar.
Make it clean.

9. FOOTER

Minimal dark footer with:
Hackathons | Organizers | Explore | About | Contact
Social links.

⭐ DESIGN & AESTHETIC DIRECTION

Dark background

Neon cosmic accents (red, purple, blue)

Glows, gradients, orbit lines

Modern, premium feel

Slight motion but not too much

Youthful but not childish

Card hover animations (tiny lift + glow)

Fade-up scroll animations (subtle)

Fast-loading, smooth

Avoid:

Cartoon icons

Heavy blur/glow spam

Too many particles

Overly noisy visuals

⭐ COMPONENTS YOU MUST BUILD

We need fully reusable components:

1. HackathonCard

(dynamic, scalable)

2. ExploreCard

(expandable – MUST allow new items later)

3. HappeningNowCard
4. PartnerLogoRow

Keep all components modular so we can reuse them across pages.

⭐ PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

Lighthouse score 90+

Optimized images (WebP)

Lazy loading

No heavy JS libraries

Smooth animations

Preload hero background

Minimize CLS shifts

⭐ RESPONSIVE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Mobile-first layout

Cards stack cleanly

Big buttons for thumb taps

Navbar collapses to hamburger

CTA stays visible on mobile

No horizontal scroll issues

⭐ BACKEND / CMS REQUIREMENTS

We need the ability to update:

Hackathons

Happening Now cards

Explore cards

Organizer pages

WITHOUT editing code.

Use a simple CMS (Sanity/Strapi/Notion API/JSON config).

⭐ DELIVERABLES

Before coding UI:
→ Send me a wireframe of all sections (just structure, no colors).
Once approved:
→ Start UI design + development.

⭐ END OF BRIEF

Copy-paste the entire thing above.
This is a perfect developer brief — he won’t need to ask you 50 questions later.
