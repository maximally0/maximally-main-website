Prompt: "Full-Stack SEO Optimization for Maximally.in"
You're an expert full-stack SEO and frontend engineer. You are optimizing the Maximally.in website, a React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS project using shadcn/ui, deployed via Replit. This is a social-edtech startup for Indian teenagers focused on teaching real-world skills like AI, digital marketing, public speaking, no-code, etc.

Goal:
Make the site SEO-optimized, fast, crawlable, and discoverable by search engines, targeting India.

1. Page-Level SEO Optimization (Apply to all pages)
For each page in the site structure (Home, BootCamps, Community, About, Team, Blog, Sponsor, Contact):

Generate a relevant title tag using primary keywords

Create a meta description (max 155 chars, compelling, keyword-rich)

Add relevant meta keywords (avoid stuffing)

Use semantic HTML tags where possible (<section>, <article>, <main>, <footer>, etc.)

Add canonical URLs

Generate Open Graph tags and Twitter Card tags

Generate favicon and social preview image placeholders

2. Keyword Strategy (India-focused)
Generate a set of primary and secondary keywords for each of these focus areas:

Teen education India

Digital marketing for students

AI and tech bootcamps India

Public speaking and debate programs for teens

Skill-building for Gen Z in India

Use these keywords naturally in:

Page content

H1, H2, H3 headings

Image alt text

Button labels

URLs and slugs (/bootcamps/ai-marketing vs just /bootcamps)

3. Performance Optimization
Optimize for Core Web Vitals: CLS, FCP, LCP

Use lazy loading on images and non-critical components

Minify and tree-shake unused Tailwind + shadcn/ui styles

Ensure responsive meta tag is present

Enable Gzip or Brotli compression

Optimize JS bundle split and defer non-critical JS

Add loading="lazy" and decoding="async" to images

4. Schema & Structured Data
Add appropriate schema.org structured data (JSON-LD) for:

Organization

WebSite

BreadcrumbList (for blog + bootcamp pages)

Article (for blogs)

Event (for bootcamps)

5. Accessibility + Crawlability
Add alt text to all meaningful images

Ensure all pages have one <h1> tag

All links should have clear anchor text

Check and fix broken links or orphan pages

Generate and expose a sitemap.xml

Generate a robots.txt file (allow all for now)

6. Content Suggestions (Optional but Smart)
For Blog page: Suggest 5 blog topics based on SEO trends in teen education + skill-building

For About page: Generate a 150-word SEO-friendly intro to the mission

For Sponsor page: Add keywords like “fund education India”, “sponsor student programs”, “CSR for youth”

7. Internal Linking Strategy
On all content pages, suggest or auto-link to related sections like:

From BootCamps → Community

From Sponsor → About, Blog

From Blog → BootCamps or Contact

Keep URL slugs short, readable, and keyword-friendly

8. Final Output
Generate updated head tags for each page

Suggest or implement file structure changes if needed

Provide a report or code output with before/after for key files (e.g. index.tsx, bootcamps.tsx, sponsor.tsx, etc.)

Keep output readable, and usable directly in Replit's editor
