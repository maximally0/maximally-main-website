      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">What Is the Maximally Makeathon?</h2>
      <p>
        The Maximally Makeathon is India's most future-forward, one-week startup bootcamp designed specifically for teens aged 13 to 18. It gives students a real taste of what it means to be an entrepreneur — from brainstorming ideas and building teams to creating prototypes and pitching in front of real investors.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Who Can Join the Makeathon?</h2>
      <p>
        Any student between 13 to 18 years old, from any school board or background, can apply. Whether you're a tech geek, a curious designer, or just someone with wild ideas — this is for you. No prior experience in startups or coding is needed. In fact, most participants are first-time builders!
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">What Do Students Learn?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the course of 7 days, students go through a high-energy, high-impact learning journey:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Ideation & Problem Solving</strong></li>

      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">How Are Teams Formed?</h2>
      <p>
        We form teams strategically by pairing students with different strengths: techies, creatives, analysts, presenters, etc. This simulates real startup environments where diverse teams drive innovation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Is It Safe and Supervised?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely. All sessions are held in safe, monitored spaces, and participants are guided by trained facilitators and mentors. If it's a residential program, accommodations are fully secured, and we maintain 24/7 adult supervision.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">What Happens on Demo Day?</h2>
      <p>
        On the final day, teams pitch their startup to a panel of real investors, founders, and industry mentors. Top teams may get awards, incubation opportunities, or even early-stage mentorship from Maximally's startup network.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">What Do Parents Need to Know?</h2>

        Not at all! Over 60% of our successful participants start with zero coding experience. We focus on no-code tools and teach you to think like an entrepreneur first, technologist second.

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">What If I Don't Have a Team?</h2>
      <p>
        No worries! Most participants come individually, and we have a structured team formation process. We pair students based on complementary skills, interests, and working styles. Many of our strongest teams are formed during the event itself.
