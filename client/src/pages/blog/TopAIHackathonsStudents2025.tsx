        Let's be honest: most hackathons can feel overwhelming. You see posts about AI models, lines of code, massive prizes ‚Äî and you think, <strong>"That's not for me‚Ä¶ yet."</strong> But what if there was a hackathon made for beginners? One that welcomed students still figuring out what AI even is?
