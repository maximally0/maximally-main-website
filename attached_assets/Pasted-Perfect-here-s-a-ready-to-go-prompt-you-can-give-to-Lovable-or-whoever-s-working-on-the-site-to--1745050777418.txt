Perfect — here's a ready-to-go prompt you can give to Lovable (or whoever’s working on the site) to execute all these changes without breaking existing content or structure:

## 🧠 Lovable Prompt: `/bootcamps` Enhancements (April Revamp)

Hey! I’ve got a few additions and upgrades to the `/bootcamps` page — **please follow this exactly**, **don’t break or remove existing content**, and **just add or reposition** as needed. Everything should still match Maximally’s aesthetic (solid colors, clean structure, Minecraft x SaaS vibe). Here's what I want:

---

### 1. 🗺 Application Timeline / Roadmap (New Section)
**Add this as a new visual section** (preferably right before the “Apply Now” button or near the top):
```
📍 Application Roadmap

1. 🚀 Applications Open (April 20)
2. 🎥 Submit your application + 1-minute intro video
3. 🔍 Get reviewed by our team
4. 📩 Selected? You’ll get an acceptance mail by May 30
5. 💳 Pay ₹2,500 to confirm your seat
6. 🎉 Bootcamp starts June 1

⏰ Final Deadline to Apply: May 29
```

Make this timeline visual, with icons or fun graphics (like quest stages). Think “treasure map” vibes but clean and readable.

### 2. 🧠 FAQ Section (Expanded)
Add a section at the **bottom of the page** called:
```
❓ Frequently Asked Questions
```
Include these Q&As (accordion/dropdown format preferred):
- **Do I need to know how to code?**  
  Nope! We cover AI & no-code tools that anyone can use.
  
- **What if I’m shy or introverted?**  
  You’re welcome here. We help you build confidence, not just skills.
  
- **Is this for kids from big cities only?**  
  Not at all. We’ve got students from small towns across India. All that matters is ambition.
  
- **Will I get personal feedback or help?**  
  Yes. You’ll have mentors, peers, and our team to guide you.
  
- **What happens after the bootcamp?**  
  You join a lifelong alumni network with exclusive access to events, internships, and more.

### 3. 🎁 “What You’ll Walk Away With” (Merged with Perks Section)
Take the existing perks section and **expand** it to include these new points (if not already covered):

- ✅ A real MVP or startup prototype  
- ✅ Personal pitch deck & branding assets  
- ✅ Letter of recommendation (top performers)  
- ✅ Internship opportunities via network  
- ✅ Certificate of Excellence  
- ✅ Resume-worthy experience

Feel free to use emojis/icons for each.

### 4. ⏳ Add a Countdown Timer
Place a **countdown timer bar or block** somewhere visible (under the hero section or floating/sticky if possible):

```
⏳ Applications Close In: [Live Countdown to May 29, 11:59 PM IST]

Only 200 students. First come, first served.
```

Can be in red or highlight color to build urgency.
