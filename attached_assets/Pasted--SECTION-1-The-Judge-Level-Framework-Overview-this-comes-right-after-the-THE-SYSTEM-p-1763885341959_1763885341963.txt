# **SECTION 1 — The Judge Level Framework (Overview)**

*this comes right after the “THE SYSTEM” part and before individual tiers.*

---

## **THE JUDGE LEVEL FRAMEWORK**

A global standard for credibility in innovation.

Every Maximally Judge is placed into one of five levels — a clear, transparent hierarchy that reflects their expertise, experience, and impact. This isn’t about titles. It’s about proof of work. What you’ve built, what you’ve led, and how you shape the next generation of builders.

Your level is your starting point.

Your journey is in your hands.

From first-time mentors to ecosystem legends, this framework creates a shared language across all Maximally events — ensuring every builder is evaluated with fairness, depth, and world-class judgment.

### **The Five Levels**

- **Level 1 — Starter Judge**
    
    Early professionals and first-time mentors beginning their judging journey.
    
- **Level 2 — Verified Judge**
    
    Experienced builders with proven domain expertise and prior judging or mentoring experience.
    
- **Level 3 — Senior Judge**
    
    Established leaders with deep professional or entrepreneurial backgrounds and consistent judging history.
    
- **Level 4 — Chief Judge**
    
    High-credibility industry or academic leaders who oversee panels and define judging quality standards.
    
- **Level 5 — Legacy Judge**
    
    Distinguished figures recognized for long-term contributions to innovation and mentorship.
# **SECTION 2 — Criteria For Each Level**

A Maximally Judge’s level reflects three things:

**(1) what they’ve built**

# **SECTION 3 — How Judges Grow Inside Maximally**

---

Being a Maximally Judge is not a fixed label.

It’s a progression system — the more you judge, mentor, and contribute, the higher you rise.

We evaluate every judge across four pillars, and your tier evolves as your impact grows.

---

## **THE FOUR PILLARS OF PROGRESSION**

### **1. Judging Credits**

Every event you judge adds to your permanent track record.

Credits are earned based on:

- number of events judged
- complexity of the tracks (beginner → advanced → finals)
- role in event (judge → lead judge → panel head)

These credits travel with you across seasons, panels, and years.

---

### **2. Feedback Quality**

Great judges give great feedback.

We evaluate:

- clarity
- specificity
- depth of insight
- usefulness to builders
- fairness and consistency

Judges with consistently strong feedback move up faster.

---

### **3. Reliability & Professionalism**

Your ability to show up matters.

We track:

- punctuality
- completing all assigned evaluations
- communication when unavailable
- zero ghosting
- zero conflicts of interest

Reliability = trust.

Trust = higher tiers.

---

### **4. Community Contribution**

Not mandatory, but a big signal.

This includes:

- taking workshops or mentorship sessions
- advising organizers
- helping design rubrics or tracks
- referring strong judges
- contributing to MFHOP or Maximally events

It shows leadership beyond scoring submissions.

---

# **HOW PROMOTIONS WORK**

We review every judge at the end of each Maximally season.

### **L1 → L2: Getting Verified**

You move up when you:

- judge 1–2 events
- give strong feedback
- show reliability
- demonstrate domain depth
    
    **Most active judges achieve this within one season.**
    

---

### **L2 → L3: Becoming Senior**

You move up when you:

- judge multiple events across categories
- show consistent high-quality evaluation
- demonstrate strong professional advancement
- show ability to guide juniors
- optionally lead smaller panels

This marks you as a mature evaluator.

---

### **L3 → L4: Becoming Chief Judge**

You move up when you:

- lead panels or full tracks
- help design judging frameworks
- mentor Level 1–2 judges
- show leadership qualities in the community
- become a trusted evaluator for major rounds

This tier is rare.

---

### **L4 → L5: Achieving Legacy Status**

Reserved for long-term contributors who:

- shape innovation ecosystems
- consistently elevate the standard
- have judged major events over years
- act as ambassadors for the movement
- bring outsized credibility and influence

Legacy Judge is the highest honor in the Maximally universe.

---

# **THE RULE**

> Your level reflects your impact — not your title.
The more you build, contribute, and mentor, the higher you rise.

# **SECTION 4 — Fast-Track & Direct Placement**

---

Not everyone needs to start at Level 1.

Some people have already built enough, led enough, and contributed enough to enter the Maximally system at a higher tier from day one.

Our fast-track process ensures that accomplished founders, senior engineers, researchers, and leaders are placed where their experience actually belongs — instantly.

---

## **WHY FAST-TRACK EXISTS**

Innovation moves fast.

Credibility should too.

Judges with strong professional backgrounds shouldn't wait to “climb” the ladder from the bottom. If your track record proves you already operate at Level 3, 4, or 5, we reflect that immediately.

No gatekeeping.

No unnecessary thresholds.

Just placing talent where it deserves to be.

---

# **FAST-TRACK CRITERIA**

## **Fast-Track to Level 3 — Senior Judge**

Given to individuals with deep domain expertise and strong leadership history.

**Examples:**

- Staff / Principal / Senior engineers at top tech companies
- Senior product managers or designers with shipped products at scale
- Founders of funded or revenue-generating startups
- Experienced mentors, devrel leads, or community builders
- Judges of major hackathons, accelerators, or competitions

**Why they skip Levels 1–2:**

They already have the depth required to evaluate complex ideas and guide junior judges.

---

## **Fast-Track to Level 4 — Chief Judge**

Reserved for senior leaders who have overseen teams, programs, or innovation processes.

**Examples:**

- Directors, VPs, CTOs, or Heads of Engineering
- Distinguished researchers, professors, or lab leads
- Founders of scaled companies with significant user or revenue traction
- Senior ecosystem operators (accelerators, venture funds, technical programs)

**Why they skip Levels 1–3:**

They have operated at evaluation-level leadership for years.

They don’t just judge — they *define how judging should work*.

---

## **Direct Legacy Placement — Level 5**

Extremely rare.

Given to figures whose work has shaped ecosystems or industries.

**Examples:**

- Founders of iconic companies
- Globally recognized researchers or inventors
- Distinguished engineers with patents, open-source influence, or industry-shaping contributions
- Senior academic or technical leaders with global legacy status
- Senior partners or leaders in major innovation ecosystems

**Why they skip the entire ladder:**

Their presence itself sets a new standard of credibility.

They mentor generations, not just events.

**Note:**

> Direct Legacy placement is invite-only or requires exceptional portfolio review.
> 

---

# **HOW FAST-TRACK EVALUATION WORKS**

We review:

- professional seniority
- projects and products shipped
- ecosystem impact
- leadership roles
- prior judging or mentorship experience
- public work (talks, research, OSS, writing)

If your profile shows you're already operating at a higher tier, we elevate you immediately.

---

# **THE PROMISE**

> We don’t make you prove what your career has already proven.
Your level reflects your true credibility — from the very first day.

# **SECTION 5 — What We Expect From Every Maximally Judge**

---

Great judging isn’t just about scoring projects.

It’s about showing up with professionalism, clarity, and real respect for builders.

Every Maximally Judge — regardless of level — follows the same core responsibilities.

---

## **1. Show Up. Fully.**

- Attend the judging session you commit to
- Be on time
- Complete all assigned evaluations
- Communicate early if anything changes

Reliability is non-negotiable.

---

## **2. Review Every Assigned Submission**

Each project deserves fairness.

We expect judges to:

- read thoroughly
- explore demos
- evaluate based on the rubric
- give scores grounded in reasoning

Builders put hours into their work — judges should too.

---

## **3. Give Specific, Actionable Feedback**

Good judges don’t say “good project.”

They say:

- what was strong
- what could be better
- what direction to take next
- how to turn the idea into something real

Feedback is mentorship.

Mentorship is impact.

---

## **4. Stay Fair and Unbiased**

Judges must:

- avoid favoritism
- avoid scoring bias based on school, resume, or background
- evaluate only the work presented
- declare conflicts of interest immediately

We protect fairness at all costs.

---

## **5. Respect Young & Emerging Builders**

Maximally events include teenagers, beginners, and first-time founders.

Judges must:

- be encouraging, not discouraging
- provide clarity without arrogance
- guide without dismissing ambition
- remember that early feedback can shape someone’s life direction

We build people, not just scorecards.

---

## **6. Maintain Professional Conduct**

This includes:

- no harassment
- no rude comments
- no mocking of projects
- no public criticism outside the judging environment
- maintaining confidentiality where required

Judging is a leadership role.

We expect leadership behavior.

---

## **7. Protect the Integrity of the System**

Judges agree to:

- avoid leaking scoring details
- avoid sharing internal judging conversations
- respect panel decisions
- help maintain judging standards

Maximally is building a global trust layer — and trust requires discipline.

---

# **THE BOTTOM LINE**

> If you show up, review with depth, give strong feedback, and respect the process — you rise fast.
If you ghost, disrespect builders, or break trust — you lose access.
