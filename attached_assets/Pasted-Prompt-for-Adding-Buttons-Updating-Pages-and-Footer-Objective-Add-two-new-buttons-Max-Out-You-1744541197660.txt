Prompt for Adding Buttons, Updating Pages, and Footer

Objective:

Add two new buttons: "Max Out Your Potential" and "Join Our Community."

Create a new page for "Community" and add links to WhatsApp and Discord.

Remove the "Power Up Your Skills" section.

Make the footer functional.

1. Add Two New Buttons
Button 1: "Max Out Your Potential"

Action: Add a button on the homepage with the text "Max Out Your Potential".

Functionality: The button should link to the appropriate section on the homepage or a relevant page based on your requirements.

Button 2: "Join Our Community"

Action: Add a new button with the text "Join Our Community" below or in a prominent position on the homepage (make it visually attractive).

Functionality: This button should redirect users to the new /community page (a new page we will create).

Design: Make both buttons visually consistent with the rest of the website, using the theme of your website.

2. Create a New Page: "Community"
Action: Create a new page at /community that introduces users to your community.

On this page, add WhatsApp and Discord links for joining the respective groups (you will provide the links later).

Design the page so it is engaging, inviting users to join the community and interact with like-minded individuals.

Text: Include some copy about the benefits of joining your community (you can provide text for this later).

3. Remove "Power Up Your Skills" Section
Action: Remove the "Power Up Your Skills" section from below the "Start Learning" button and above "Choose Your Power-ups".

This section currently feels out of place, so removing it will streamline the page and make it more cohesive.

4. Make the Footer Functional
Action: Review and update the footer to ensure all links and sections are functioning properly.

Add any missing links to the footer (for example, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and other important links).

Ensure the Contact Us and Social Media links are visible and working.

Check if the "Join Our Community" button or other relevant sections should be added to the footer for easy navigation.
