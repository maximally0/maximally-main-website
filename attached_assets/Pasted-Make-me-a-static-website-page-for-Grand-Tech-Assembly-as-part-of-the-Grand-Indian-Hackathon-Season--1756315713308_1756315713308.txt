Motifs: GTA mission badge, minimap HUD bar, pixel heart, soft grain, light halftone, subtle scanlines.

Fonts: Monument Extended or Outfit for headings, Inter for body. Tight letter-spacing on headings.

Layout: Single scroll. Big hero, then crisp cards. Plenty of negative space. 12-column grid. Sticky top nav with two CTAs. Section headers use mission-card tabs. Icons are simple line glyphs, not heavy art.
