1. Filters & Navigation

Collapse filters into dropdowns: Right now the filter list is long (AI, Autumn, Chaos, etc.). Make each section collapsible (Location, Status, Duration, Focus Areas). Keeps the sidebar clean.

Active filter badges: When someone applies filters, show small badges above the event list (e.g., “Online ✕ 48 hours ✕ AI”). Makes it obvious what’s being applied.

Default “Upcoming” view: Most people care about what’s next, not past events. Auto-show only upcoming events first.

2. Search & Discovery

Smart search suggestions: When typing “AI”, show related tags or event names dynamically.

Highlight popular tags: Instead of listing all focus areas in a long checklist, highlight the top 5–6 as quick “chips” (like buttons) that people can tap. The rest stay hidden under “More”.

3. Event Cards

Consistency in prize info: Some say “TBD”, some “₹5000+”. Pick a consistent format and maybe show it under a “Prizes” label, not floating in a box.

Key info hierarchy:

Title (biggest)

Status + Date + Duration (second line, easy scan)

Prize (highlighted)

Expandable sections: Instead of the red dropdown arrow, make the whole card expandable (click anywhere). Right now it feels too “button-y”.

4. Visual Clarity

Reduce red saturation: Red is heavy on the eyes. Keep red as accent (titles, highlights), but let backgrounds breathe more with black/gray.

Hover states: Add hover effects (slight glow or scale) to buttons and event cards. Feels interactive and responsive.

Spacing: Right now text blocks feel a bit tight. Add 10–15% more padding inside cards.

5. Footer & Info

Simplify footer links: You’ve got Events, Community, Content, Company, Support. Nice grid, but too spread. Maybe reduce to 3 groups: Events, Community, Help.

One-line mission: The “global hackathon league…” text is good, but it can sit above events, not buried at the bottom. Keeps purpose clear.

6. Small UX Touches

“Add to Calendar” button on each event → Google/Outlook/Apple link.

Countdown timers for upcoming hackathons (“Starts in 10d 3h”).

Dark mode toggle: You already have the icon in navbar — make it functional. Some users will prefer lighter tones if they’re browsing long.
