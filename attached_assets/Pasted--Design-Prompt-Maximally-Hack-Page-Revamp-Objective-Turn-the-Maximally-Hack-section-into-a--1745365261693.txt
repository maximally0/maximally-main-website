🎨✨ Design Prompt: "Maximally Hack - Page Revamp"
Objective:
Turn the Maximally Hack section into a vibrant, interactive landing page that feels like a gamified pixel-world meets futuristic SaaS portal. This isn’t just an event page — it should feel like you're stepping into a digital guild hall for teen innovators.

🌈 General Vibe:
Color Palette: Bright gradients (purples, neons, pastels), plus pixel-style overlays (grids, sparkles, floating cubes).

Typography: Bold headings with pixel-style or retro arcade fonts; modern sans-serif for body.

Layout: Use card-based layout with soft shadows, glowing borders, and hover effects.

Background: Subtle parallax background animation — floating pixel elements like stars, gears, potions, chat bubbles.

🔧 Key Animations & Interactions:
Floating Elements:

Pixel-art icons (like a wizard hat, rocket, lightbulb, scroll, code block) slowly float in background using framer-motion or CSS @keyframes.

Guild Point System Section:

Make it look like a game leaderboard or dashboard. Animated XP bars, blinking stars on top teams.

"Why Participate?" Section:

Animate each point as a card that flips or bounces on hover. Add subtle sparkles or glows around important words.

Track Cards:

Show as “Quest Scrolls” — when hovered, they unroll with details. Include pixel borders, and floating 8-bit icons per track (e.g., AI bot, heart for mental health, $ for fintech).

"Golden Ticket to Maximally" Badge:

Shiny golden badge with pulsing glow and slight rotation. Tooltip on hover with info.

"Judges & Mentors" Section:

Each mentor/judge profile as a floating card with pixelated frame. On hover: retro-style CRT distortion effect.

CTA Section ("Join the Movement"):

Flashing retro button like:
>> ENTER THE QUEST <<
Pixel-glow animation when hovered.

🧩 Bonus Touches:
Cursor: Custom Minecraft-style sword or wand cursor.

Sound FX (optional): Retro chime when opening/closing modals or hovering buttons.

Loading Animation: An 8-bit loading bar or hourglass that says “Loading your quest...”

Page transitions: Retro game-style fade-in or “slide in” panels when scrolling.
