Perfect — here is the **Maximally 2.0 homepage layout**, designed with *UI/UX as the #1 priority*, using the new 9 categories and your lightweight tech philosophy.

This is structured exactly how a top-tier designer would wireframe it.

Everything below is meant to be clean, minimal, aesthetic, and very “builder culture × futuristic grid.”
