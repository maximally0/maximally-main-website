        When 15-year-old Shreya from Kolkata first heard about Maximally's makeathon, her immediate thought was "I'm not good enough at coding." Six months later, she's the CEO of an EdTech startup serving 8,000+ students across Bengal, has raised ₹15 lakhs in seed funding, and regularly speaks at technology conferences about girls in entrepreneurship. Her transformation from self-doubt to industry leadership exemplifies how Maximally's inclusive approach is revolutionizing STEM participation for young women.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">Overcoming Impostor Syndrome</h3>
      <p>
        Many girls enter makeathons believing they don't belong in technology spaces. Through structured support and incremental achievements, they develop genuine confidence in their technical and leadership abilities.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">Developing Leadership Skills</h3>
      <p>
        Girls often emerge as natural leaders during makeathons, taking on roles in product strategy, user research, team coordination, and business development. These experiences build leadership confidence that transfers to all areas of life.

      <p>
        The challenges facing society—from climate change to healthcare access to educational equity—require diverse perspectives and innovative solutions. When we exclude girls from STEM education and entrepreneurship, we lose half of our potential problem-solvers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Maximally's makeathons prove that given the right environment, support, and opportunities, girls don't just participate in technology—they lead it. They create solutions that address real needs, build teams that achieve ambitious goals, and inspire others to follow their example.
