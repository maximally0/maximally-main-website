              When was the last time you played with technology—not for work, not for profit, but just because it was fun?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That's the spirit behind Project CodeGen, a 48-hour hackathon happening on October 11–12, 2025. And unlike the hackathons you've seen before, this one doesn't care about disruption, fundraising, or investor pitches.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-bold">This one's about joy.</p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">A Hackathon That Feels Like a Playground</h2>
            
            <p>
              Most hackathons are pressure cookers. Build fast, pitch sharp, hope for a prize. But what if you stripped away the seriousness and treated it like a giant science fair?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              That's what Project CodeGen is doing. It invites coders, designers, artists, no-coders—anyone who likes tinkering—to bring out their inner kid. Think:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Interfaces that look like doodles</li>
              <li>Games that don't take themselves seriously</li>
              <li>Apps that are fun to use even if they're totally impractical</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              It's the first hackathon where making someone laugh is as valid as making something "scalable."
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Why Play Matters in Tech</h2>
            
            <p>
              Play isn't a distraction. It's one of the most underrated engines of creativity.
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Google's best ideas once came from 20% time, where engineers built side projects "just for fun."</li>
              <li>Scratch introduced millions of kids to coding—not through theory, but through play.</li>
              <li>Even AI art tools today are often used first for silly experiments before becoming serious design workflows.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              By lowering the stakes, play frees people to build things they otherwise wouldn't. That's exactly the kind of mindset innovation actually needs.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What You Can Build at Project CodeGen</h2>
            
            <p>
              The rules are simple: if it's playful, it works. Some examples floating around:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>A to-do list app where tasks explode when you finish them</li>
              <li>A meme generator that only outputs cursed images</li>
              <li>A game where the tutorial is more fun than the gameplay</li>
              <li>A Pomodoro timer that roasts you if you slack off</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              You don't have to impress a VC. You just have to make something delightfully weird.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Judging Without the Stress</h2>
            
            <p>
              Instead of high-pressure pitches, Project CodeGen has asynchronous judging. You submit your prototype + short write-up, maybe throw in a one-minute demo video if you want.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Judges—designers, educators, indie hackers—will score based on:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Imagination (30%)</li>
              <li>Execution (25%)</li>
              <li>Usefulness in disguise (20%)</li>
              <li>Presentation (15%)</li>
              <li>Joy factor (10%)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Notice how "joy" actually counts. That alone makes it different.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Why You Should Join</h2>
            
            <p>
              This hackathon isn't just for pros. It's open to:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Teen builders</li>
              <li>First-time coders</li>
              <li>Artists and designers</li>
              <li>Scratch veterans</li>
              <li>People who miss the fun side of making</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Whether you're 14 or 40, if you've ever wanted to just make something silly, colorful, and alive, this is for you.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Final Thought</h2>
            
            <p>
              We take tech too seriously. Every product has to "scale," every app has to "disrupt."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Project CodeGen flips that. It says: What if the point isn't disruption, but delight?
            </p>
            
            <p>
              On October 11–12, for 48 hours, you'll get to build like you're 6 years old—and ship like you're 16.
            </p>
