          🤝 <strong>Big News:</strong> Masters' Union, one of India's most forward-thinking institutions for business and entrepreneurship, is officially backing the upcoming <strong>Maximally Startup Make-a-thon (July 1–7)</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        This is more than a sponsorship. It's a meeting of two visions that believe in one thing: <strong>the best way to learn is to build</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-maximally-red mt-8 mb-4">🏢 Why Masters' Union</h2>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg space-y-4">
        <p>
          Masters' Union has become a standout name in higher education by doing things differently. Their campus doesn't look like a college — it <strong>feels like a startup hub</strong>. Founders and CXOs teach classes, students work on live ventures, and the focus is always on building, not just theory.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That mindset matches exactly what Maximally is creating for teenagers: spaces where students stop waiting for permission and start shipping their first ideas into the real world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="bg-maximally-blue/10 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
        <p className="font-bold text-maximally-blue">
          💡 <strong>Bold Signal:</strong> By supporting the Startup Make-a-thon, Masters' Union is signaling something bold — innovation in India shouldn't wait until after school. It should start right now.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-maximally-red mt-8 mb-4">🚀 What the Make-a-thon is About</h2>

      <p>
        From <strong>July 1–7</strong>, students across the country will come together online to launch their first startup in one week. No long prep, no overthinking. Just scrappy teams, raw ideas, and the thrill of building under pressure.
