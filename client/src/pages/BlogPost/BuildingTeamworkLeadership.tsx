      <p className="text-lg">
        In today's world, being smart isn't enough — you need to work with others, lead ideas, and adapt fast. At Maximally's Makeathon, teens are not just building startups — they're building essential people skills that set them apart in school, college, and life.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">How Does Maximally Teach Teamwork?</h2>
      <p>
        Over the 7-day journey, teens are grouped into diverse teams where roles naturally emerge. Some take the lead. Some design. Others analyze or research. But no one can win alone.
      </p>
      
      <p>Here's what students experience:</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">1. Collaborative Brainstorming</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone's ideas are heard, valued, and shaped into something bigger. Teens learn to listen, build on others' suggestions, and move from chaos to clarity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">2. Shared Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Teams split tasks—market research, designing, building prototypes, preparing pitches. Students learn time management, commitment, and the cost of not delivering.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">3. Constructive Conflict</h3>
      <p>
        Not everyone agrees. That's the point. Teens learn to resolve disagreements with respect and logic—not ego.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">4. Leadership from the Ground Up</h3>
      <p>
        Leadership isn't about being the loudest. It's about helping the team move forward. Many discover their inner leader not by leading from the front, but by supporting others.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Soft Skills That Last a Lifetime</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Confidence</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Accountability</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Resilience</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Public Speaking</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These are not just startup skills. They're life skills — and students take them back to school projects, competitions, and even college interviews.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Real-World Applications</h2>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">In Academic Settings</h3>
      <p>
        Students who participate in makeathons consistently perform better in group projects, demonstrate stronger presentation skills, and show improved leadership in student organizations.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">In Professional Environments</h3>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-press-start text-maximally-blue mt-6 mb-3">In Personal Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Participants develop confidence in their ability to contribute meaningfully to teams, handle disagreements constructively, and take on leadership responsibilities when situations require it.
      </p>
