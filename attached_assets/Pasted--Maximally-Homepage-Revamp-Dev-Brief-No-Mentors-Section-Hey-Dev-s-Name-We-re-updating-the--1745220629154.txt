🎨 Maximally Homepage Revamp – Dev Brief (No Mentors Section)
Hey [Dev's Name],

We’re updating the Maximally homepage to be clearer, cooler, and more conversion-optimized — but still keeping our original theme:

Minecraft pixel-art meets modern SaaS.

Here’s what I need from you:

🔧 1. Theme & Visuals
Preserve the pixel vibe — continue using pixel elements, emojis, and retro-inspired UI.

Typography: Use bold, modern sans-serif fonts with pixel-style accents (headings/buttons like “Level Up” and “Power-Ups”).

Colors: Add more colorful accents (neon blues, pixel greens, soft purples) to highlight phrases like "Learn by Doing", "Level Up", etc.

Use pixel icons or micro-animations next to headings (like 🚀, 💥, 🧠) to enhance the fun/gamified feeling.

📐 2. Layout Flow (Updated Structure)
[Hero Section]

Headline: “The Real-World School for Ambitious Teenagers”

Subhead: “Learn what school doesn’t teach. Build projects. Speak with power. Launch your first startup.”

CTAs: [Start Learning] and [Join the Community]

Background: Think pixel clouds or a Minecraft-style skyline subtly animated

[What is Maximally?]

2-column layout:
Left = clean, bold explanation text
Right = pixel-style animation (e.g. teens leveling up or building with blocks)

[Power-Ups Section]

Each skill (Entrepreneurship, Public Speaking, etc.) shown as a pixel-art card

Hover effects or subtle animations

"Level Up >" buttons styled like 8-bit game elements

[Bootcamp Promo Section]

Title: “The Summer of a Lifetime Starts Here”

Subtext about the 2025 bootcamp

Background: Pixel summer camp vibe (campfire, tents, stars, etc.)

CTA: [Apply Now] styled like a “Start Mission” button in a retro game

[Why Maximally Works]

4 core benefits in grid format

Pixel-style checkmarks/icons: ✅ 🎯 🧪 ⚡

Example:

✅ Learn by Doing

⚡ Interactive, no boring lectures

🎯 Real feedback & growth

🧪 Built for Gen Z, by Gen Z

[Growth Journey Section]

Visual representation of levels:
Noob → Starter → Pro → Founder

Maybe design this like a gamified progress map or pixel ladder

Use XP bar, stage indicators, or character leveling style

[Partner With Us Section]

Layout like a co-op video game menu screen

3 clickable buttons:

Schools → Bring Maximally to your students

Creators → Teach & inspire

Organizations → Co-create high-impact programs

Add pixel-style glow, hover, and click effects

[Final CTA Section]

Title: “Ready to Start?”

Subtext: “Join the movement. Build your future.”

Background: Pixel rocket launch or fireworks

CTA: [Get Started] as a glowing 8-bit style button

🖼 Bonus Styling Notes
Add hover easter eggs (e.g. crown pops up when hovering over “Founder”)

Use pixel textures subtly in backgrounds (sky, stars, bricks, grids)

Optional: XP bar or gamified badge like “Level: Starter” for logged-in users
