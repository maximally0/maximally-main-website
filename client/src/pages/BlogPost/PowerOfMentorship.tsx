        When 16-year-old Shreya from Ahmedabad pitched her EdTech idea to her assigned mentor at Maximally's makeathon, she expected polite feedback. Instead, she received a 30-minute deep dive into market analysis, competitive positioning, and scaling strategies from someone who had built and sold three successful startups. Six months later, Shreya's platform serves 15,000+ students across Gujarat, and she credits her mentor's guidance as the turning point in her entrepreneurial journey.

        <strong>This transformative mentorship experience isn't unique at Maximally. It's the cornerstone of why 70% of makeathon participants continue building their startups post-event, compared to less than 10% at traditional hackathons.</strong>
