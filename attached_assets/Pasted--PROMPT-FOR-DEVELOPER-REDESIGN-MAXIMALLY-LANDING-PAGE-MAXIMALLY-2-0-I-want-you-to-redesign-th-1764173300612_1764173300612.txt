🚀 PROMPT FOR DEVELOPER — REDESIGN MAXIMALLY LANDING PAGE (MAXIMALLY 2.0)

I want you to redesign the entire Maximally landing page into a clean, minimal, world-class UI with UI/UX as the top priority.

The new Maximally is an opportunity platform for young builders (developers, founders, designers, creators), focused on tech/startup/digital programs.

We want the landing page to feel:

futuristic

clean

structured

minimal

builder-first

high-contrast

grid-based

with lots of breathing space

simple components (to keep dev light)

Avoid clutter. Avoid “busy” UI. Avoid corporate/boring Unstop style.

🔥 FINAL CATEGORY SYSTEM (USE THESE ON HOMEPAGE)

Please use these 9 categories in a clean 3×3 grid:

Hackathons

Startup Competitions

AI & Tech Challenges

Fellowships

Accelerators

Bootcamps

Grants & Funding

Internships & Startup Gigs

Workshops & Events

Each card should have:

icon

title

tiny 1-line subtext

subtle border

hover lift + soft glow
