🚀 Maximally Makeathon 2025
June 1–2 | For India’s most ambitious teen builders

Maximally Makeathon is a 48-hour sprint where high schoolers from across India come together to build, launch, and show off real-world tech projects. Whether you're a code wizard, a design thinker, or just have big ideas — this is your launchpad.

 

What makes it different? This isn’t just a hackathon — it’s a movement of teen founders, creators, and change-makers. Powered by the Maximally Bootcamp, you’ll be mentored by startup pros, use the same tools real builders use, and end up with something you’re proud to show off.

🔧 Build solo or with a team — no-code, low-code, full-code all welcome
