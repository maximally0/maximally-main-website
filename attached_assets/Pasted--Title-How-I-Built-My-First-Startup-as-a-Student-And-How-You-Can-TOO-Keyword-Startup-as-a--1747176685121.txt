How I Built My First Startup as a Student (And How You Can TOO)
“I didn’t wait to graduate. I started building.”
That’s the line I now use at school events when people ask me how I launched a startup before turning 18.
I’m not from IIT. I didn’t know how to code.
What did I have? A simple idea. A smartphone. And the courage to start.
If you’re a teenager, there’s never been a better time to launch your own startup. And with no-code tools, AI, and teen-focused programs like Maximally, you can go from zero to launch faster than ever.
Let me walk you through how I did it, what I learned, and how you can start building right now.

From School Project to Startup Idea
It began in class 10, during exam season.
I noticed how every student in my school was stressed, confused about what to revise, and wasting time scrolling Instagram while pretending to study.
So, I thought:
What if there was a simple AI-powered revision assistant that made custom timetables and gave quick recap notes?
I didn’t call it a startup. I called it a “small project.”

Step 1: Solving a Problem You Understand
The best teen startups don’t begin with a business plan.
They start with frustration—something annoying you want to fix.
Here are a few real-world examples from teen founders:
Ananya (16) built a recycled stationery brand after noticing how many notebooks go to waste after exams.
Dev (17) launched a digital store for school clubs using Glide and Google Sheets.
Jiya (15) created an AI journaling app for mental health after her friend faced burnout.
Tip: Look around your school, home, or city.
What are people struggling with? What do you wish existed?
That’s where your startup idea is waiting.

Step 2: Using No-Code Tools to Build Fast
When I had the idea for QuickPrep, I had no clue how to code. But I discovered something that changed my life:
No-code tools = Power to build without programming.
Here are a few tools I used (and still recommend):
🔧 Glide
Turn Google Sheets into apps. I built my first prototype in 1 weekend.
💬 ChatGPT
I used it to:
Draft daily revision messages
Build a quiz bot
Test user flow ideas
🎨 Canva
Designed the logo, mockups, and social media posts.
🧠 Tally + Notion
Created sign-up forms and user onboarding without spending a rupee.
The beauty of no-code? It forces you to focus on solving problems—not debugging code.

Step 3: Getting Feedback and Making It Real
I showed the first version of QuickPrep to 5 friends.
Guess what? They hated the colors, loved the notes, and asked for a night study mode.
That feedback was gold. I iterated, improved, and asked more classmates to try it. Within 3 weeks, 100 students were using it daily.
Lesson: Don’t build in silence. Share early. Improve fast.
Even Google started in a garage. You can start with your school WhatsApp group.

Step 4: Turning It Into a Real Startup
Once I saw people were using the tool, I got serious.
📦 I added a pricing model
Basic plan: Free
Premium: ₹99/month for access to custom schedules and audio summaries
📣 I promoted it
I pitched in my school assembly, shared it on Instagram Reels, and got 2 teachers to recommend it.
📊 I tracked growth
Used Notion to record:
Weekly active users
Feedback points
New feature requests
Soon, I hit 500 users. It felt surreal.

Step 5: Getting Mentorship at Maximally
Everything changed when I joined the Maximally Bootcamp—a 1-week startup program just for teenagers.
Here's what I learned:
How to pitch in under 60 seconds
How to tell my story with clarity
How to use AI to automate tasks
How to test features with real users
How to present at Demo Day in front of schools and parents
Maximally wasn’t just another online course. It was a launchpad.
They gave me mentors, tools, a community—and the confidence to scale.
