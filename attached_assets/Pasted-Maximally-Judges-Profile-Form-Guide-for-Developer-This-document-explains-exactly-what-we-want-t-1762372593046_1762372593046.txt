Maximally Judges – Profile Form Guide (for Developer)

This document explains exactly what we want to build for the Judge Profile system — what fields judges will fill, what’s public vs private, and how the form should work.

The goal:
Judges can fill out everything about themselves (bio, judging stats, events, etc.) manually — and this data shows up on their public profile page.
Some information is public, some stays private, and some gets verified later by us.

1. The Basic Idea

Judges make an account (or get an invite link).

They fill out their entire profile on a form.

Once they’re done, that profile becomes public on maximally.in/judges/<theirname>.

They can always come back and update it.

We (the Maximally team) can later verify certain fields — and add a ✅ tick next to verified data.

2. Form Flow

There are two parts:

Public information form – what everyone can see on their public page.

Private information form – things we need internally (but don’t show publicly).

They fill both on one dashboard — just clearly separated with a label:

“Public (visible on your profile)”
“Private (visible only to the Maximally team)”

3. Public Info (this shows on their judge profile)

This is the main section.
All of this should show publicly on their page once submitted.

4. Private Info (only visible to us)

These fields won’t show publicly, but we’ll use them for verification or communication.

Field Name	Type	Example / Notes
Email	Text	Required for login/contact
Phone Number	Text	Optional
Resume / CV	File upload	Optional PDF
Proof of Judging (images/screenshots)	File upload	Optional
Time Zone	Drop-down	For scheduling calls

Conflict of Interest	Text	“Cannot judge events by Company X”
NDA & Consent Checkboxes	Boolean	“Agree to terms and NDA”
Address (optional)	Text	Only if we ever need for reimbursements, otherwise skip
5. Verification Section (for later)

Add a small tag system next to every major stat (like events judged, mentorship hours, etc.) so we can mark them later as:

✅ Verified by Maximally

⚪ Self-declared (unverified)

It’s okay if all data is self-declared at launch.
We’ll just manually mark verified ones in the backend later.

6. What the Public Profile Should Show

When someone visits a judge’s page, it should display like this:

Profile Header

Profile photo

Name

Title / Headline

Tier (Starter / Verified / Senior / Chief / Legacy)

Country / Location

Expertise tags

✅ Verified badge (if any)

About Section

Short bio

Current role + company

Public links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

Judging Stats Section

Display the stats like this:

24 Events Judged ✅
310 Teams Evaluated ⚪
84 Hours of Mentorship ⚪
4.8 / 5 Avg Participant Feedback ⚪


(Use small tick or dot icons for verified vs unverified.)

Event Portfolio

List of past events they’ve added manually:

• Maximally AI Shipathon 2025 — Lead Judge — Verified
• TechNova 2024 — Senior Panelist — Self-declared


Each entry can show proof link if available.

Endorsements (optional future feature)

Later, we can let organizers leave a short testimonial here:

“Dr. Sharma’s feedback was incredibly actionable and encouraging.”

Contact / Invite

At bottom:

Button: “Invite to Judge”

Shows LinkedIn / Email

Optional note: “Available for judging March–May 2026”

7. Admin Controls (for us only)

We can see everything (public + private).

We can mark any field as “verified.”

We can change their tier (Starter → Verified → Senior → Chief → Legacy).

We can hide/unpublish a judge profile anytime.

8. Optional Notes for Dev

Keep the form clean and modern — 2-step layout (Public Info / Private Info tabs).

Auto-save progress as they type.

Add a progress bar (“Profile 80% complete”).

Judges should be able to preview their public profile before it goes live.

Simple backend toggle to make profiles public once approved.

9. TL;DR Summary

Here’s how to think of it:

Everything is manual at start.

Judges can enter all info themselves — stats, events, bio, etc.

We’ll verify later by adding ticks next to verified data.

Public = what’s visible on their page.

Private = what we keep internally (email, phone, etc.).

Admin can edit, verify, or hide any field
