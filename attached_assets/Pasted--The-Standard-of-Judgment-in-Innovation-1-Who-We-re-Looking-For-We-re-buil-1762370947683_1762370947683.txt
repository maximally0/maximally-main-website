### *The Standard of Judgment in Innovation.*

---

## 🌍 1. Who We’re Looking For

We’re building a **network of the top 1%** — founders, engineers, researchers, designers, and leaders who’ve *built real things* and *want to mentor the next generation of builders.*

You are not a “guest judge.”

You are a **cultural architect of innovation** — someone who has earned the right to evaluate others because you’ve already built, led, and created.

We are not looking for volume.

We are looking for **signal.**

---

## 🧩 2. The Core Criteria

Each Maximally Judge is evaluated across six pillars:

---

### **A. Proven Builders**

> You’ve built, shipped, or scaled something real.
> 

You’ve spent years **building systems, products, or ideas that reached the world.**

You understand how chaos turns into clarity — and how prototypes become impact.

**Examples we value:**

- Founders and early builders of startups or open-source projects.
- Senior engineers at global companies (AWS, Google, Meta, etc.).
- Researchers, product managers, or designers with real shipped work.
- Educators or creators who’ve built communities around technology.

---

### **B. Domain Mastery**

> You’ve gone deep enough to see the pattern.
> 

We don’t just want breadth — we want depth.

You can recognize excellence because you *operate within it.*

**You might be:**

- A researcher with published work or patents.
- A senior technologist who leads teams or architectures.
- A designer or creative director who has built recognizable work.
- A product or startup mentor with demonstrated impact.

**We look for:**

- 7+ years of professional experience, or
- demonstrable mastery in a specific technical, creative, or entrepreneurial domain.

---

### **C. Ethical Mentorship**

> You’re not here to flex. You’re here to elevate.
> 

Maximally Judges aren’t critics — they’re catalysts.

We want mentors who can inspire confidence, provide tangible feedback, and expand a participant’s creative bandwidth.

**Signals we value:**

- Mentored teams in hackathons, accelerators, or bootcamps.
- Leadership experience (team building, teaching, coaching).
- History of constructive feedback and builder-first mindset.

---

### **D. Thought Leadership**

> You think about the future — and influence others to reach it.
> 

Judging innovation isn’t about opinion; it’s about perspective.

Our judges shape the dialogue of what innovation means — in technology, design, systems, and culture.

**Indicators:**

- Speaker at conferences, podcasts, or panels.
- Contributor to open-source, research, or public learning.
- Recognized within your community for your clarity of thought.

---

### **E. Reputation & Credibility**

> Your name already carries weight — Maximally makes it public.
> 

We invite people who’ve earned **institutional or professional credibility** — those trusted by their peers, employers, or ecosystems.

**Examples:**

- Senior roles at reputable companies or institutions.
- Recognized memberships (IEEE, ACM, Y Combinator alum, university fellow, etc.).
- Media or public recognition for projects or leadership.
- Verified work in global tech, design, or innovation ecosystems.

---

### **F. Philosophical Alignment**

> You resonate with the Maximally way of building.
> 

We celebrate speed, chaos, creativity, and learning through failure.

Our judges must **appreciate the art in experimentation** — and the courage in incomplete genius.

We’re not looking for rulebook evaluators.

We’re looking for those who understand that innovation is messy — and that *breakthroughs look like mistakes at first.*

## 🏅 3. The Evaluation Rubric (Internal Use)

When we review applications, we score each candidate across 5 axes:

| Axis | Description | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Credibility** | Role, seniority, organization, and reputation in the ecosystem | 25% |
| **Experience Depth** | Years of domain mastery and tangible projects | 20% |
| **Mentorship Quality** | Ability to give constructive, encouraging, and actionable feedback | 20% |
| **Thought Leadership** | Public speaking, writing, open-source, teaching, etc. | 15% |
| **Cultural Alignment** | Builder-first mindset, curiosity, love for chaos, generosity | 20% |

**Minimum threshold:** 80/100 to qualify as a *Verified Maximally Judge.*

Top 10% receive *Elite Tier* or *Lead Judge* status.

---

## 🧠 4. Who We Don’t Accept

We reject:

- Recruiters, consultants, or PR people trying to use the title for clout.
- “AI experts” who have never built or shipped anything.
- People whose resumes are long but their curiosity is short.
- Anyone who treats judging as a chore instead of a privilege.

This program is not for everyone — it’s for the **builders who care deeply about the next generation of builders.**

---

## 🌎 5. Our Philosophy: Judging ≠ Scoring

To us, *judging* means *translating potential into growth.*

You’re not here to pick winners — you’re here to identify sparks.

A Maximally Judge is part critic, part teacher, part philosopher.

We don’t rate creativity; we **recognize it.**

---

## ⚡ 7. The Bar

We don’t measure by numbers.

We measure by *impact, clarity, and integrity.*
