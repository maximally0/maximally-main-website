Masters' Union backs Maximally Startup Make-a-thon

June 10, 2025

We're excited to share that Masters' Union, one of India's most forward-thinking institutions for business and entrepreneurship, is officially backing the upcoming Maximally Startup Make-a-thon (July 1–7).

This is more than a sponsorship. It's a meeting of two visions that believe in one thing: the best way to learn is to build.

## Why Masters' Union

Masters' Union has become a standout name in higher education by doing things differently. Their campus doesn't look like a college — it feels like a startup hub. Founders and CXOs teach classes, students work on live ventures, and the focus is always on building, not just theory.

That mindset matches exactly what Maximally is creating for teenagers: spaces where students stop waiting for permission and start shipping their first ideas into the real world.

By supporting the Startup Make-a-thon, Masters' Union is signaling something bold — innovation in India shouldn't wait until after school. It should start right now.

## What the Make-a-thon is about

From July 1–7, students across the country will come together online to launch their first startup in one week. No long prep, no overthinking. Just scrappy teams, raw ideas, and the thrill of building under pressure.

Participants will:

- Brainstorm and validate ideas fast
- Build prototypes and MVPs
- Pitch to mentors and judges
- Experience the real highs and lows of startup culture

The goal isn't perfection. It's creation. And thanks to Masters' Union's support, hundreds of students will get to feel that rush of turning an idea into something real.

## Shared philosophy

Maximally and Masters' Union might work with students at different stages, but the belief is the same: learning happens best in the arena, not the lecture hall.

At Maximally, high schoolers get their first taste of building through hackathons and make-a-thons.

At Masters' Union, college students learn by running ventures, working with real companies, and solving problems outside the classroom.

It's one pipeline — from first builds to full-fledged founders. And this partnership strengthens that bridge.

## What's ahead

The Startup Make-a-thon is only the beginning. This collaboration opens the door for more shared experiments, more platforms for student builders, and more ways to make "learning by building" the new normal across India.

We believe the next wave of founders is already here. They're in school, they're online, and they're ready to test ideas the moment they have them. With Masters' Union alongside us, that wave just got a lot stronger.

## Closing

This is a proud moment for us at Maximally. To have an institution like Masters' Union stand with us is not just validation, it's a push to go bigger.

The Startup Make-a-thon begins July 1. The projects will be raw, messy, and ambitious. Just like real startups. And that's exactly how it should be.

⚡ **Maximally × Masters' Union** — building the future of innovation, starting now.
