Perfect. Here’s the full **designer-style creative brief** — not technical, but deeply **vision-driven** — capturing **everything** you've shared about the **Maximally AI Shipathon**, including key sections, tone, visual identity, and emotional energy. This is the exact voice you’d give to a creative studio or brand designer you trust with your baby.

## 🎨 Creative Direction for: `maximally.in/shipathon`

**Name:** Maximally AI Shipathon
**Type:** 48-hour global hackathon
**Date:** Aug 30 – Sept 1, 2025
**Theme:** AI x Chaos x Creativity
**Audience:** Teenagers & young creators (first-timers, no-coders, hackers, designers, musicians, memers, students)

---

### 🧠 Overall Feel:

This page isn’t a brochure.
It’s a **vibe portal**.
You enter `maximally.in/shipathon` and feel like you’ve stumbled upon a **digital island built by rebel teenagers**, coded in the ruins of a startup crash, powered by raw energy and AI dust.

It’s glitchy. It’s bold. It’s weird. And it *knows you’re here to build*.

The entire design should **feel like a playground + pirate terminal**.
Somewhere between:

* A pixel-art shipwrecked beach
* A hacked retro terminal interface
* A Gen Z meme jungle
* And the kind of vibe that says: *“You won’t survive unless you ship.”*

### 🔴 Visual Identity: The Maximally Core

* **Main Colors**:

  * 🔴 **Maximally Red (#E50914)** – dominance, CTA, energy
  * ⚫ **Pure Black / Terminal Grey** – backdrop, containers
  * 🟡 **Pixel Yellow (#FFD700)** – hover states, outlines, highlight
  * 💠 Accents: glitch-blue, CRT scanlines, arcade patterns

* **Font Style**:

  * **Monument Extended** for headers → bold, commanding
  * **Pixel/Arcade-style fonts** for buttons and titles
  * **Outfit or Satoshi** for body → clean, modern, teenage-readable

* **Imagery**:

  * Pixel islands, crates, boats, relics, tools
  * Floating message bottles with emojis inside
  * Glitchy overlays — VHS grain, flicker transitions
  * 8-bit builders on the beach
