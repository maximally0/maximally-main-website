              Hackathons are wild—one moment you're sketching ideas on a notepad, the next you're racing against the clock to build something demo-worthy. But here's the thing: great ideas often stumble at the execution stage. That's exactly where Project Codegen steps in.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Instead of getting stuck writing boilerplate code or setting up endless configs, Codegen lets you jump straight into building. It's like having a teammate who already knows the frameworks, the syntax, and the shortcuts.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Why Execution is the Hardest Part</h2>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> You've got 24–48 hours. Every minute matters.</li>
              <li><strong>Team sync:</strong> Not everyone codes at the same speed.</li>
              <li><strong>Setup hell:</strong> Half the battle is getting your environment running.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              With Codegen, you skip the chaos and move faster: the tool generates starter code, structures your project, and even suggests fixes while you focus on features and creativity.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Turning Ideas Into Demos</h2>
            
            <p>
              Imagine this:
            </p>
            
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>You pitch a mental health app that tracks moods.</li>
              <li>Normally, you'd spend 6 hours setting up backend + auth.</li>
              <li>With Codegen, you generate the base in minutes and dive straight into building the actual mood-tracking logic.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
              That's what separates dreamers from demo-ers. And in hackathons, demos win prizes.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">The Secret Advantage in Hackathons</h2>
            
            <p>
              When judges see your project, they're not just looking at the idea — they're looking at execution, polish, and how much you achieved in limited time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Codegen gives you that edge:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Cleaner structure</li>
              <li>Faster iteration</li>
              <li>More time to refine UI/UX</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              In short: less time debugging, more time impressing.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Real Impact on Hackathon Success</h2>
            
            <p>
              The difference between "nice idea" and "prize-winning project" often comes down to these factors:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> Does it actually work?</li>
              <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Is it intuitive and polished?</li>
              <li><strong>Demo Quality:</strong> Can you show real functionality?</li>
              <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Did you finish what you started?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Project Codegen addresses each of these by removing the technical friction that typically consumes 60-70% of hackathon time.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Beyond the Hackathon Weekend</h2>
            
            <p>
              But here's what's really exciting: the skills and speed you develop using Codegen don't disappear when the hackathon ends. You're learning to think in terms of rapid prototyping, efficient iteration, and focused execution.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              These are exactly the skills that separate successful builders from eternal planners.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="font-press-start text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Final Take</h2>
            
            <p>
              Hackathons reward speed, creativity, and execution. Project Codegen doesn't just help you code faster — it helps you win smarter. Because at the end of the day, the difference between "nice idea" and "prize-winning project" is execution.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              And Codegen is here to make sure your execution shines.
