What is Project CodeGen?

Not about disruption or MVPs. It’s about play. Drop the pitch decks, pick up crayons. Build like a kid — silly ideas, joyful logic, weird prototypes. Make tech fun again.

Vibe + Theme

Inspired by notebooks, toys, science fairs

Feels like Lego builds, Scratch projects, doodles in class

Serious design? Allowed. Serious tone? Nope.

You’re not building for VCs. You’re building for your younger self.
