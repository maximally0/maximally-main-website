Absolutely, here’s a **full prompt** you can copy-paste and send directly to your developer (or Lovable or your AI assistant). It clearly explains everything you want changed on the `/bootcamps` page in one solid, structured format — clear enough to execute without confusion, and creative enough to match your vision:

### 🔧 Prompt: /bootcamps Page Restructure & UI Update (Maximally)

> 🎯 **Objective**: Reformat and restructure the `/bootcamps` page on the Maximally website to improve visual flow, emphasize key value propositions, and modernize layout with dropdowns, color highlights, and minimalist sectioning.

---

### 📚 **SECTION RESTRUCTURE**

1. **Reorder Sections as Follows**:
   - ✅ Keep the main CTA section ("Our most ambitious teens... Will you?") at the top but...
     - Set **background to pure white**
     - Keep layout **minimalist**, but
     - Use **colorful text highlights** on keywords like:
       - **"most ambitious"**
       - **"this summer"**
       - **"accepted"**
       - **"certificate of excellence"**
       - **"you're in for life"**
       - Highlight these using solid `bg-*` color classes or underlines/accents.

2. **Immediately after the main CTA**, add this section:
   - 🏆 **"Accepted? You’re In for Life"** section  
     - Place this **right after Apply Now button**
     - Style it as a **standout block** — border or light background  
     - Use emphasis/styling to highlight benefits like:
       - “Certificate of Excellence”
       - “Alumni-Only Privileges”
       - “Lifetime Network Access”

3. **Next Section**:  
   - 🎁 **Perks & Alumni Privileges**  
     - Move this **up the page** as the **second major block**
     - Use iconography, cards, or grid layout for each perk
     - Each perk should be **visually elevated** with color blocks

4. **Followed By**:  
   - 👥 **Who Should Apply**  
     - Place this as the third section
     - Highlight phrases like “build their first ₹1CR”, “teen founders”, “ambitious teens”, etc.
     - Use solid backgrounds or pills to highlight these phrases

### 📅 **CURRICULUM (7-Day Schedule)**

- Convert current Day 1 → Day 7 curriculum content into a **collapsible dropdown component**.
- Each day should be inside a **dropdown block or accordion item**, labeled clearly:
  - `Day 1: Kickoff & Team Formation`
  - `Day 2: Problem → Idea`
  - `Day 3: MVP Planning`
  - ...
  - etc.
- Move the full Curriculum dropdown **towards the bottom half of the page**, ideally above or beside FAQs.

---

### 🧠 **Misc Visual + Functional Updates**

- Use **solid background blocks** only. NO dynamic/gradient backgrounds.
- Make typography **bold and oversized**, especially headlines like:
  - “Apply Now”
  - “Accepted? You’re In for Life”
  - “Bootcamp Curriculum”
- For all callouts like:
  - ₹2,500
  - June 1–8
  - Limited to 200 students
  - Application-based only  
  — Add **high contrast highlights** (`bg-yellow-200`, `bg-red-100`, `text-blue-600`, etc.)
- Add **emojis or pixel-style icons** sparingly for section headings (e.g., 🧠, 🏆, 💼, 🛠️)
