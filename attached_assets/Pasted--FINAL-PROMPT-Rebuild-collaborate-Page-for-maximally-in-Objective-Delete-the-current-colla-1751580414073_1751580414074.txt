🔧 FINAL PROMPT — Rebuild /collaborate Page for maximally.in
📌 Objective:
Delete the current /collaborate page on https://maximally.in, and replace it with a clean, structured, and expandable layout that showcases all the ways individuals and organizations can collaborate with Maximally — now a global, hackathon-first innovation league.

This new /collaborate page is designed to attract and onboard sponsors, ecosystem partners, tool builders, communities, content creators, and institutions that want to support, co-create with, or grow alongside Maximally.

🧱 PAGE STRUCTURE & DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS
Page Title:
Let’s Collaborate.

Intro/Subheading (under title):

Maximally is a global, hackathon-first innovation league. If you’re a brand, startup, platform, or community looking to reach Gen Z builders and young founders — this is your invitation to collaborate.

Use a dropdown accordion UI or expandable card layout.

Each main category below should be collapsible.

Inside each category, just list the titles of the collaboration types (for now). Do not add detailed descriptions yet.

All dropdowns should be collapsed by default.

Use Maximally’s pixel-block red-yellow aesthetic — bold red (#E50914), bright yellow (#FFD700), sharp fonts, glitch/arcade vibes optional.
