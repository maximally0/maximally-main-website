You are an AI website editor working on Maximally — a bold, Gen Z-first startup platform.

Maximally is now **exclusively a hackathon and innovation events company**. We no longer run bootcamps, skill courses, or learning journeys. We only run **high-stakes, startup-style hackathons and youth innovation competitions** — designed for ambitious teens who want to build real things and gain public proof of work.

Please **revamp the homepage** (`/`) from top to bottom to reflect this. Follow these precise instructions:

---

🔴 1. HERO SECTION — REWRITE

Replace everything in the current hero section.

**New Headline:**  
🚨 _Welcome to the Maximally League_  
India’s boldest hackathon ecosystem for teen founders, coders, and creators.

**Subtext:**  
No lectures. No theory. Just high-pressure innovation events for teens who want to launch, compete, and grow fast.

**CTAs:**  
- “Explore Events” (→ `/events`)
- “Join the League” (→ `/community`)

---

🧹 2. REMOVE THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS COMPLETELY:
- "Start Learning"
- "Apply for Makeathon"
- "Learn Real Skills"
- "Grow Faster"
- "Your Growth Journey"
- Any “Startup Makeathon” promo blocks
- Any reference to formats (we are not listing them yet)
- Any CTAs related to “bootcamps”, “programs”, or “courses”

---

🧩 3. ADD A NEW SECTION: “What We Do”

Simple 2–3 line section that reads:

> **What We Do**  
We host India’s most rebellious startup events for teenagers.  
High-stakes hackathons, chaos sprints, and public launch challenges — built for Gen Z.

CTA: “See Past Editions” (→ `/events`)

---

🤝 4. REWRITE “Partner With Us” SECTION

Keep the idea, but reframe the language to suit hackathons.

**New Title**:  
Let’s Build India’s Innovation League — Together.

**Body Copy**:  
We collaborate with schools, creators, and brands to run youth-focused hackathons that inspire bold execution and real proof of work.  
If you want to empower the next generation of builders — let’s talk.

CTA: “Partner With Us” (→ `/collaborate`)

---

🧭 5. UPDATE FOOTER

Update all sections and navigation to reflect the new direction.

Remove or rewrite:
- “Skill Bootcamps”
- “Startup Makeathon”
- “Progressive Schools”
- “Programs”

Replace with:

**EVENTS**  
- Past Hackathons  
- Upcoming Challenges

**COMMUNITY**

**COMPANY**  
- About Maximally

🎨 6. VISUAL STYLE

Keep the pixel-glitch-arcade-red aesthetic — the rebellious Gen Z hacker-core vibe.  
Use bold type, glitch overlays, and minimal text blocks. Prioritize movement, youth, and startup-coded storytelling.

---

✅ Final Goal:
Make this homepage feel like a **digital battleground for teen innovation**. Visitors should know:
> “Maximally runs crazy hackathons for ambitious teens — and if you want in, you better build something.”

No outdated CTAs. No education language. No unnecessary sections.  
Just a clean, bold, energy-filled site that shows Maximally = Hackathons Only.

Let me know if you need me to write the actual homepage section-by-section. I’m ready.
