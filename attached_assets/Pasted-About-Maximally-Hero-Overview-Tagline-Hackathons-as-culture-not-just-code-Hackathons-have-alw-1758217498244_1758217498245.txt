About Maximally
Hero / Overview

Tagline: Hackathons as culture, not just code.

Hackathons have always been more than just code. They are experiments in how people think, create, and work together under pressure. They are places where rules bend, ideas collide, and the boundaries of what’s possible shift overnight. Yet, for too long, hackathons have been scattered — run in silos, limited by geography, or tied to a single school or company.

Maximally was born out of a simple belief: hackathons deserve to be open, accessible, and cultural. They should not just be occasional events but a living system — a space where anyone, anywhere, can test ideas, build with others, and feel seen.

What We’re Building

Hackathons (Events): Where it all started. We run global online and hybrid hackathons with open themes, beginner-friendly tracks, and experimental formats.

Maximally Platform (MaximallyHack): An AI-native hackathon platform that gives organizers creative tools for submissions, judging, and community engagement.

Federation (MFHOP): A cross-school, cross-company network where organizers share resources, partnerships, and reach.

Studios: Content around hackathons, innovation, and youth culture — documenting stories and voices of builders.

Community: A living network of participants, mentors, and judges that stays connected long after events end.
