        As a school administrator, you're constantly balancing competing priorities: improving student outcomes, managing limited budgets, satisfying parent expectations, and meeting state requirements. Every program decision must deliver measurable value while aligning with your institution's broader educational mission.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Makeathons represent a unique opportunity to address multiple institutional goals simultaneously while creating transformative experiences that students, parents, and faculty remember long after graduation.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">The Challenge of 21st Century Education</h2>
      
      <p>
        Traditional educational metrics—standardized test scores, graduation rates, college acceptance percentages—while important, fail to capture the full scope of skills students need for future success. Employers consistently report that recent graduates lack critical thinking abilities, collaboration skills, and innovative problem-solving approaches, despite strong academic credentials.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Meanwhile, student engagement continues to decline, particularly in STEM subjects where workforce demand is highest. Many capable students lose interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics not because they lack ability, but because they can't see the relevance and impact of these subjects in addressing real-world challenges.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Measurable Outcomes from Makeathon Implementation</h2>
