      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">"Aren't Startups Just for Adults?"</h2>
      
      <p className="text-lg">
        That's what most people think. But here's the truth: teenagers today are more equipped than ever to solve real-world problems. With access to technology, creativity, and curiosity — all they need is the right launchpad.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>That's where Maximally's Makeathon comes in.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Startups Begin With a Simple Idea</h2>
      
      <p>
        Every successful startup begins with a simple question: <em>"Why hasn't anyone solved this yet?"</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Teens have fresh eyes. They spot gaps in the world that adults often overlook. Be it school life, climate issues, mental health, or everyday annoyances — they have lived experiences and bold ideas.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What they need is the environment to nurture that spark into a startup.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Skills &gt; Age</h2>
      
      <p>
        Building a startup doesn't require an MBA or a fancy office. It requires:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Problem-solving</li>
        <li>Empathy for users</li>
        <li>Creativity and grit</li>
        <li>Adaptability</li>
        <li>Teamwork</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        These are skills teenagers can absolutely develop — and that's exactly what the Makeathon experience is designed to build.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Tools and Tech Are No Longer a Barrier</h2>
      
      <p>
        In today's world, teens don't need to code or hire a designer to build a startup. With no-code tools, AI support, and collaborative platforms, the barriers to entry are lower than ever.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>A student with a laptop and an idea can build a working prototype within a week.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Why the Right Mentorship Matters</h2>
      
      <p>
        Even with talent and tools, young founders need guidance. Mentors at Maximally don't tell students what to build — they teach them how to think like a founder:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>How to validate ideas</li>
        <li>How to communicate clearly</li>
        <li>How to bounce back from failure</li>
        <li>How to pitch with confidence</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        It's not just startup training. It's a mindset shift — from consumer to creator.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Real Examples of Teen Success</h2>
      
      <p>
        The evidence is everywhere. Teen entrepreneurs are already making their mark:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Building apps that help students manage mental health</li>
        <li>Creating platforms that connect communities</li>
        <li>Developing solutions for environmental challenges</li>
        <li>Designing tools that make education more accessible</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        These aren't just school projects — they're real solutions addressing real problems.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">The Maximally Advantage</h2>
      
      <p>
        What makes Maximally's approach different? We don't just teach theory — we provide:
      </p>

        <li><strong>Real mentorship:</strong> Learn from successful entrepreneurs and industry experts</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">From Idea to Impact</h2>
      
      <p>
        The journey from having an idea to building something that matters isn't easy — but it's absolutely possible. Here's what the process looks like:
      </p>
      
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Identify a problem</strong> you're passionate about solving</li>
        <li><strong>Research and validate</strong> that others share this problem</li>
        <li><strong>Design a solution</strong> that addresses the core issue</li>
        <li><strong>Build a prototype</strong> to test your assumptions</li>
        <li><strong>Get feedback</strong> from real users</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate and improve</strong> based on what you learn</li>
        <li><strong>Scale and impact</strong> more lives</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        This isn't just a business process — it's a life skill that applies to any challenge you'll face.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-press-start text-maximally-black mt-8 mb-4">Beyond Just Business</h2>
      
      <p>
        Building a startup teaches you skills that go far beyond entrepreneurship:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> How to motivate and coordinate teams</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> How to present ideas clearly and persuasively</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> How to bounce back from setbacks and failures</li>
        <li><strong>Critical thinking:</strong> How to analyze problems and evaluate solutions</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> How to understand and serve user needs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        These skills make you better at everything — from school projects to future careers to personal relationships.
      </p>
