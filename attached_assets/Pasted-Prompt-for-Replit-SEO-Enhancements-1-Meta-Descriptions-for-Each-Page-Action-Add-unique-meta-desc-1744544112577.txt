Prompt for Replit: SEO Enhancements
1. Meta Descriptions for Each Page

Action: Add unique meta descriptions for each page/route.

Each page, like /digital-marketing, /public-speaking, etc., should have its own tailored description that accurately reflects the content of that page.

Ensure these descriptions are between 150-160 characters.

Status: Currently only a basic description is available for the homepage.

2. Canonical Tags

Action: Implement canonical tags on pages where duplicate content may exist.

This will help search engines know which version of a page should be indexed.

Example: <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.maximally.in/digital-marketing" /> for the digital marketing page.

Status: Not currently implemented.

3. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Action: Add structured data (JSON-LD) for the main pages to improve search engine understanding and enhance search results.

Add schema.org types such as Organization, WebPage, Article (for blog posts), and BreadcrumbList.

Example for the homepage:

json

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Maximally",
  "url": "https://www.maximally.in",
  "description": "Maximally helps young adults build real-world skills to accelerate their careers."
}
Status: Not currently implemented.

4. Google Analytics Setup

Verify tracking is working correctly by using the Google Tag Assistant or Google Analytics Real-Time feature.

Status: Not currently set up.

5. Open Graph/Twitter Cards Optimization

Action: Refine the Open Graph and Twitter Card tags for better social sharing.

Ensure that each page has specific tags. For example:

For Open Graph: <meta property="og:title" content="Maximally - Learn Real-World Skills" />

For Twitter Cards: <meta name="twitter:title" content="Maximally - Learn Real-World Skills" />

Status: Basic implementation present, but needs further refinement.
