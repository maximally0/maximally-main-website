You're an AI website editor working on Maximally — a high-stakes, Gen Z-first hackathon league for teenage builders, creators, and rogue innovators.

Maximally is **not India-only**. While the community originated in India and supports emerging teen innovators from across the country, the brand is **global-first** — we believe innovation is borderless, age-agnostic, and internet-native.

Please go through **every page of the website** (including Home, Events, Community, Collaborate, Blog, and Footer) and **make the following edits**:

---

### 🌍 1. Remove all “India-only” references
- Delete or reword any copy that says “India’s biggest…”, “across India…”, “Indian teens…”, etc.
- If necessary, reword it to phrases like:
  - “teen innovators worldwide”
  - “young builders from across the globe”
  - “borderless innovation”
  - “ambitious teenagers around the world”
  - “emerging youth ecosystems”

---

### 🌐 2. Reframe regional pride without limiting scope
- When referencing our roots or traction, use language like:
> “Born in India. Built for the world.”
> “Fueling the next wave of global innovation — starting from teen builders.”

- Acknowledge support for Indian youth without making the platform India-exclusive.

---

### 🧑‍🚀 3. Align with a global, age-agnostic philosophy
- Add this core idea in your About/Community sections:
> “At Maximally, we believe innovation has no borders — and no age limits. Whether you're 13 or 19, from a metro or a small town, if you're building bold things, you belong here.”

### 🧾 4. Update SEO, meta titles, and alt-text
- Anywhere “India’s #1” or similar phrases appear in meta titles or descriptions, revise them to reflect Maximally’s **global outlook** and teen innovation leadership.

Example:  
**Old**: “India’s #1 Startup Makeathon for Teenagers”  
**New**: “The Global Hackathon League for Teen Builders”

---

### 🧭 5. Footer + Navigation Edits
- Remove categories like:
  - “Progressive Schools Across India”
  - “India’s Biggest Startup Sprint”
- Replace with:
  - “Global Innovation Community”
  - “Hackathons for Gen Z, Everywhere”

---

🎨 Final Style Direction:
Keep Maximally’s Gen Z glitch-red aesthetic. Just remove the local limitation in messaging and make the brand feel like a **global rebellion against boring education and passive innovation.**

---

🧠 Summary:
Maximally = Global-first, Gen Z-only, execution-first.  
Not Indian-only.  
Not local.  
Not traditional.

Do not leave any phrasing that limits this scope.

Let me know if you’d like help rewriting any “About Us” section or social bio too.
