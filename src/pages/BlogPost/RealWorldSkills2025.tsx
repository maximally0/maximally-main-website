        <p className="mb-4">You know the drill:<br />Study hard ➝ Top marks ➝ Top college ➝ Top job<br />Except… that ladder's broken.</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">

          <li><strong>Your GPA doesn't show how well you pitch, lead, create, or adapt</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The best opportunities go to those who've <em>done</em> stuff</strong>, not just studied it</li>
