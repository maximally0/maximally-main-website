        ðŸŽ¤ Speaking Up Can Change Your Lifeâ€”Even If Your Hands Shake
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Do your palms get sweaty just thinking about speaking in front of your class? Does raising your hand during a discussion feel like a battle against your own brain?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        You're not alone. Public speaking is one of the top fears among teensâ€”but it's also one of the most life-changing skills you can learn.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Whether you're introverted, shy, or just unsureâ€”public speaking for teens isn't about being loud, it's about being heard.

        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">What Is Public Speaking (and Why Should Teens Care)?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Public speaking is more than giving speeches. It's about expressing your ideas clearlyâ€”on stage, in class, in interviews, and even online.</p>
        <div className="pixel-border p-6 bg-maximally-blue/5">
          <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">ðŸ”¥ Why It Matters:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Helps you speak up in class discussions</li>
            <li>Prepares you for debates, interviews, and college admissions</li>
            <li>Builds confidence in expressing your ideas</li>
            <li>Boosts leadership, communication, and critical thinking skills</li>

        <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">Real Talk: Why Most Teens Avoid Public Speaking</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Let's be honest: Public speaking feels scary because it's public. We fear:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Being judged</li>
          <li>Forgetting our words</li>
          <li>Sounding "awkward" or "cringe"</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">But the truth? Nobody is born a good speaker.</p>
        <p>Even the best TED speakers started somewhereâ€”most were scared at first too. What separates them is that they practiced, made mistakes, and kept showing up.</p>

        <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">Real Teen Example: Ananya's Story</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ananya (15) used to avoid class presentations. One day, she joined her school's MUN (Model United Nations) after a friend convinced her. At first, she barely spoke. But week after week, she practiced short speeches at homeâ€”and at her next conference, she won Best Delegate.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">Now, she's preparing for college interviews and leads her school's public speaking club.</p>
        <p className="font-press-start text-sm">Moral? Public speaking didn't change who she wasâ€”it revealed who she could become.</p>
