# 🌍 **Why This Exists**

Maximally is building the world’s most powerful hackathon ecosystem — a global OS for hackathons.

We help schools, colleges, startups, and communities run **insane, high-energy hackathons** with:

* full-stack infra
* submissions + judging systems
* sponsors + mentors
* branding + ops
* templates + playbooks
* MFHOP federation access

We’ve already hosted and co-organized 10+ global hackathons, brought thousands of builders together, and partnered with judges from Google, Microsoft, Meta, AWS, McKinsey, Warner Bros Discovery, and more.

Now we want to **scale this globally** — bigger events, wilder formats, more locations, more opportunities.

And we want **you** to be part of the movement.
