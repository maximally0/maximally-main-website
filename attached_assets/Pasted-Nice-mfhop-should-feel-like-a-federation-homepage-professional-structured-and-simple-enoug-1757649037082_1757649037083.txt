Nice â€” /mfhop should feel like a **federation homepage**: professional, structured, and simple enough that organizers skim, nod, and apply. Think of it as a **one-pager microsite**. Hereâ€™s a layout and draft content you can plug in:

## **What is MFHOP?**

Short paragraph, plain startup tone:
MFHOP is an initiative led by Maximally to bring hackathon organizers out of silos. Whether you run a college hackathon, an indie Devpost event, or a community competition, MFHOP helps you connect with peers, trade sponsor leads, cross-promote events, and build credibility. Membership is free, and open to any organizer who has hosted at least one hackathon.
