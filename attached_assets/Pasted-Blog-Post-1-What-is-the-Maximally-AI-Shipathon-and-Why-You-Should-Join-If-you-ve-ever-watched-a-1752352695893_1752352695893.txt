Blog Post 3: No Code? No Problem: How Anyone Can Join the AI Shipathon 

So you’ve heard about AI. Maybe even messed around with ChatGPT. But when someone says "build an AI project," you panic because you don’t know how to code. 

Here’s the good news: you don’t need to. 

That’s the whole point of the Maximally AI Shipathon — to give you a fun, fast, no-pressure way to build cool things with AI, even if you’ve never touched code. 

Shape 

What is No-Code Anyway? 

Think of it like this — instead of writing instructions in programming languages, you use tools with drag-and-drop features, ready-made templates, and simple automations. It’s like building with LEGO instead of sculpting from scratch. 

With tools like: 

Glide – turn Google Sheets into apps 

Canva + Notion AI – design and content made easy 

Make.com – automate actions across apps (like Zapier) 

Voiceflow – build voice assistants and chatbots 

ChatGPT + DALL·E – content + design generation 

you can build your own AI product. No coding. Just creativity. 

Shape 

Real Stuff You Can Build (Yes, You!) 

A personal chatbot that answers questions for your school project 

An AI-powered journaling app 

A pitch deck generator using GPT and Canva 

A quiz app with image scoring using DALL·E 

A smart marketplace that filters items based on user intent 

If you can imagine it, you can start building it.

Blog Post 4: How I Built My First AI Project in 48 Hours (And You Can Too) 

Let me take you back 48 hours. I was staring at a blank Google Doc, part of a fresh team I’d never met before, in the middle of my first ever AI hackathon for beginners. The challenge? Build an AI-powered solution to a real-world problem using no code AI tools. 

I’d never built an app. I didn’t even know what a “workflow” was. I just knew I liked solving problems and learning new things. And now, I had 48 hours to go from zero to something. 

Step 1: Picking the Problem 

Our team brainstormed fast. We all agreed on one thing — school life can get overwhelming. Too many assignments, projects, club events, and personal goals. So, we decided to build a personal AI assistant for students that keeps everything organized. 

The idea was simple: an app that takes your weekly tasks and suggests a balanced schedule — like a planner that thinks. 

Step 2: Choosing the Tools 

Here’s what we used: - Notion AI: For note capturing and automatic task summaries - Make.com: To automate syncing between Google Calendar and Notion - Glide: To build the mobile app interface - ChatGPT API: To analyze inputs and give back smart advice 

No one in our team was a coder. But these tools felt like magic. We were dragging, connecting, testing. And suddenly, the pieces started working together. 

Step 3: Failing (A Lot) 

Our first version was a disaster. The UI was clunky, the AI responses were off, and one automation loop kept sending the same reminder 50 times. We laughed, fixed it, broke something else, and fixed it again. 

But that’s when the real learning happened. Every fail taught us something — about logic, user experience, time management, and teamwork. 

Step 4: Demo Day 

When we presented, it wasn’t perfect. But it worked. Our AI assistant could: - Take in a list of tasks from the user - Categorize them into academics, health, and personal goals - Suggest a realistic schedule and even recommend Pomodoro breaks 

The judges were impressed. Not because it was the flashiest app, but because we had an idea, built a real thing, and explained it like creators.

What I Learned 

AI isn’t just for coders. If you can think logically and creatively, you can build. 

No code is powerful. It’s not a shortcut — it’s a launchpad. 

Teamwork > Solo genius. My teammates brought skills I didn’t have, and vice versa. 

Done > Perfect. You’ll learn more by finishing one imperfect thing than dreaming about a perfect one you never start. 

Why You Should Try It 

If you’re still waiting to feel “ready,” you’ll be waiting forever. The truth is, nobody feels ready at the beginning. But once you start building, everything changes. 

The Maximally AI Shipathon is designed for this. It’s your safety net and your rocket ship. You’ll be surrounded by mentors, resources, and people who want to see you win. 

It’s not about being the smartest — it’s about showing up, trying, and surprising yourself. 

TL;DR: You Can Do This 

I went from “I don’t know what I’m doing” to “I built something real” in just 48 hours. And now, you can too. 

The next great AI idea doesn’t need to come from Silicon Valley. It can come from your bedroom, your school bench, your imagination.
