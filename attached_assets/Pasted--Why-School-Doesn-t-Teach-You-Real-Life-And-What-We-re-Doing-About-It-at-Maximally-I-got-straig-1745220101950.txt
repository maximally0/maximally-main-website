🎓 Why School Doesn’t Teach You Real Life
(And What We’re Doing About It at Maximally)
“I got straight A’s… but no clue how to write an email, pitch an idea, or even file taxes.”

Sound familiar?

Let’s be real:
India’s education system is great at teaching formulas, dates, and theories — but when it comes to life after school, you’re pretty much left to figure it out on your own.
No one tells you how to negotiate, build a personal brand, or launch an idea. You just get thrown into the deep end and told to swim.

🧠 School ≠ Life
Here’s the gap:


School Teaches You...	Real Life Demands...
How to solve for X	How to sell your ideas
Memorizing history	Building your own story
Writing exams	Writing cold emails
Theory-heavy learning	Experience-driven doing
And guess what? This gap isn’t your fault. It’s the system’s.
But that doesn’t mean we just sit back and accept it.
