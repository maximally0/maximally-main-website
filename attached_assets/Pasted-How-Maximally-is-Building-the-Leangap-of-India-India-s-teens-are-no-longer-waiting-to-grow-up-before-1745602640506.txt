How Maximally is Building the Leangap of India
India’s teens are no longer waiting to grow up before building startups. Across cities and towns, a generation of young founders, creators, and changemakers are rising. And standing at the forefront of this revolution is Maximally — a bold new edtech platform that’s building what many are calling the Leangap of India.

If you’ve searched for Leangap India, teen startup programs, or startup bootcamps for high school students, you’re in the right place. Maximally is not just inspired by global models like Leangap — it's tailoring the formula for ambitious Indian teenagers.

What is Leangap — and Why Does India Need One?
Leangap is a prestigious U.S.-based summer program where high schoolers build real startups with mentorship, resources, and community. Alumni have gone on to raise millions, build YC-backed companies, and become teen CEOs.

But for most Indian students, Leangap is a distant dream — geographically, financially, and culturally.

That’s where Maximally Bootcamp steps in. Think of it as:

🚀 Leangap, reimagined for India’s top 1% of teenagers who dare to think big.
