Organize into 3 clear sections with headers: Flagships, Chaos Formats, and Wildcard Sprints

✅ Content to Inject into the Page:
🧱 FLAGSHIPS
Startup Makeathon
→ 7-day sprint from idea to MVP to public pitch. Real teams, real mentors, real pressure.

Stealth Hackathon
→ You don’t know the prompt until the timer starts. 48hr to build something wild.

Brand-a-thon
→ Flip iconic brands into new verticals. You get ₹15K, 3 days, and full creative freedom.

Case Raid
→ No boring slides. Real-world problem statements, fast-paced formats, and competitive analysis under fire.

Pitch Arena
→ Shark Tank meets battle arena. Build hype, face real judges, win real-world outcomes.

⚔️ CHAOS FORMATS
Scrapyard Showdown
→ Use discarded ideas, rogue APIs, weird UIs — just make something work and ship it.

Zero to One K
→ Earn your first ₹1,000 online. No rules. No capital. Just hustle and proof.

Shipwreck
→ Build something broken, weird, or ugly — but make it functional. Glitches welcome.

Startup Lab Rats
→ Test a bizarre startup concept publicly. If it flops, pivot. If it works, scale.

Viral or Die
→ Keep posting until one piece of content hits a goal (e.g. 10K views). Prove your virality.

The Click War
→ Create an ad + landing page. Track clicks, conversions, and win on performance.

CTRL + ALT + BUILD
→ Restart a dead project. Rebuild it cleaner, stronger, faster — within 72 hours.

🎯 WILDCARD SPRINTS
The Mic Drop
→ Convince a room to believe in your wildest idea. No slides. Just storytelling fire.

Ideological Deathmatch
→ One-on-one debate. AI vs Artists. Hustle vs Peace. Win the room, win the round.

Clout Court
→ Defend your startup like you're in court. The audience is your judge. If you lose, you're roasted.

Founder Roast
→ Pitch your startup — then get publicly roasted by your peers. Can you survive the heat?

Hype War
→ You’re selling a potato. Make it look like an Apple product launch.

Cold Street
→ Go outside. Sell something. Get a stranger to pay you. Document the win.

The ₹99 Offer
→ Turn a skill into a ₹99 service. Package, sell, and prove it worked.

The DM Derby
→ Slide into 50 DMs with a pitch. First to get 5 replies wins. Screenshots = proof.

Unreal Reels
→ Create a 30-sec video that explains your idea so well your grandma gets it.

The Thread Lab
→ Write a viral tweet/thread that breaks down a concept, startup, or story. Leaderboard = likes/views.

The Pivot Game
→ Your startup gets a rule change every 3 hours. Pivot fast or die trying.

Burn the Deck
→ No slides. No visuals. Just you, your voice, and one object. Can you pitch it?

Life Design Jam
→ Map your dream life in Notion or Figma. Reverse engineer the path. Share it with the world.

Persona Switch
→ Build like Kanye. Pitch like a villain. Design like a monk. You’re not you anymore.

Hustle Royale
→ 48hr leaderboard. As many mini-challenges as possible. Each one earns XP. Screenshots or it didn’t happen.
