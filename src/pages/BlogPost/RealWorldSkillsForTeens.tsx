        ðŸŽ¯ The Real Test Begins After the Exam Ends
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        You've spent years solving algebra problems, memorizing history dates, and writing essays about Shakespeare. But the truth hits hard when you step outside the classroom: No one ever taught you how to manage money, speak confidently, or turn your idea into a business.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Let's be honestâ€”school often skips the most important lessons.

        <p className="mb-4">Real-world skills are the practical, everyday abilities you'll use in your personal and professional life. Unlike textbook knowledge, these are the things that help you thrive in the real worldâ€”from building relationships to making your first income.</p>
        <p>Learning these early gives you a massive head start.</p>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Aarav (17) learned about budgeting during a startup bootcamp. He now tracks every rupee and invests small amounts in mutual funds.
