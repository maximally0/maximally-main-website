Objective:
Ensure that the footer is consistent and functional across all pages on the website. The footer should be visibly clear, interactive, and properly positioned.

1. Universal Footer Across All Pages:

Action: Implement a universal footer that appears consistently across all pages (including the homepage, blog, about, etc.).

The footer should have the same structure and content across all pages.

Ensure the footer is placed at the bottom of the page on every page.

Use flexbox or grid to ensure responsiveness, so the footer looks good on all screen sizes.

2. Footer Content:

Action: Verify the content in the footer is correct and is functioning properly.

Ensure all important links (like privacy, terms, contact) are present.

If there are social media links (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), make sure they are clickable and lead to the correct URLs.

Example content for the footer:

html
Copy
Edit
<footer>
  <div class="footer-content">
    <p>&copy; 2025 Maximally. All rights reserved.</p>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="/terms">Terms & Conditions</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/maximally.in">Instagram</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </div>
</footer>
3. Fix Footer Display Issues on Homepage:

Action: Investigate and fix any display issues on the homepage.

If the footer is not visible or is displayed incorrectly, debug the CSS and ensure it's positioned correctly.

Ensure the text in the footer is legible (check for color contrast, font size, etc.).

Test the footer on different screen sizes to ensure it displays properly and is fully readable.

4. Footer Interactivity:

Action: Ensure that the footer is interactive (i.e., links are clickable).

Fix any broken links in the footer.

Make sure all links lead to the correct pages (e.g., "Contact Us" should go to /contact, etc.).

Add hover effects or animations to links for better user interaction.

Example CSS for hover effect:

css
Copy
Edit
footer a:hover {
  color: #3C9EE7;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
5. Responsiveness and Testing:

Action: Test the footer across multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Ensure that the footer remains at the bottom of the screen even when there is less content on the page.

Use Tailwind's responsive classes (if applicable) to ensure the footer adapts to different screen sizes.

6. Debugging Any Footer Related Bugs:

Action: If the footer still behaves weirdly (e.g., disappearing or malfunctioning), investigate the following:

CSS issues (check for position: absolute or conflicting styles).

JavaScript issues (check if any JS is affecting the footer visibility or interaction).

HTML structure issues (verify the footer is in the correct place in the HTML hierarchy).

Ensure that there are no overlapping elements causing issues with footer visibility.

Deliverables:

A fully functional universal footer that is visible and interactive on every page.

Fixes for any display and usability issues on the homepage and other pages.

Consistent behavior across all screen sizes, with proper navigation and clear text.
