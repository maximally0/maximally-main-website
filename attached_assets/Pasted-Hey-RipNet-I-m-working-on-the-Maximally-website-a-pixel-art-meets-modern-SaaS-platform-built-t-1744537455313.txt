Hey RipNet,

I‚Äôm working on the Maximally website ‚Äî a pixel-art meets modern SaaS platform built to teach ambitious teens (13‚Äì20) skills like entrepreneurship, public speaking, MUN, digital marketing, AI, etc.

Here are the changes and expansions I want you to make now:

---

### 1. üö´ Remove All Power-Up Images
- On the homepage or dashboard, wherever the ‚ÄúPower-Ups‚Äù (like Entrepreneurship, Public Speaking, Digital Marketing, AI, etc.) are displayed, **remove the images** associated with each.
- I want this to be a **clean, text-based layout only** ‚Äî no icons, thumbnails, or banners for these categories.
- Use a bold heading, small description, and a CTA button ‚Äî keep the layout aligned with the pixel/SaaS aesthetic.

### 2. üõ† Build the Following Pages (Keep Routing Clean)
Create and link the following pages in the navigation bar and footer. Use the existing pixel-style design system (Press Start 2P or VT323, modern grid, sharp corners):

#### `/about`
- Talk about the mission: helping teens build real-world skills
- Why Maximally exists, who it‚Äôs for, and the pixel-art theme as a metaphor for leveling up
- Include a CTA to join the community

#### `/team`
- List of core contributors/founders with fun pixel-style bios
- Each team member should have:
  - Name
  - Role
  - Fun fact or catchphrase (e.g., "Built my first pitch deck at 13")

#### `/careers`
- Section for open volunteer/intern roles (content writing, Discord mods, design, etc.)
- Simple form to apply or an email contact for now

#### `/blog`
- Minimal layout for blog posts (even dummy placeholders are fine for now)
- Include search bar or filter tags if possible
- Posts should follow the pixel/retro theme

---

### Other Notes
- Keep everything responsive across devices
- Ensure fast page loads, optimized assets, and smooth routing
- All nav links should scroll to the **top of each page**, not the bottom
- Keep everything consistent with our core theme:
  - Colors: White, Electric Blue (#3C9EE7), Warm Red (#D94F45), Deep Black (#1A1A1A)
  - Fonts: Press Start 2P, VT323, JetBrains Mono

Let me know if you need a seed layout or more detailed copy ‚Äî I‚Äôll supply that next.

Thanks!
