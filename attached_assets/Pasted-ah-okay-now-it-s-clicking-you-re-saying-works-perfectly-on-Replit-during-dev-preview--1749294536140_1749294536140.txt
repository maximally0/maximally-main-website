ah okay, now it’s clicking — you're saying:

✅ works perfectly on **Replit (during dev preview)**
❌ breaks on **Netlify (after deploying)**

which means there’s likely a **build or routing mismatch between your dev environment and production**, especially around Netlify’s handling of routes and static files.

---

### 🎯 Here's the Fix Plan Step-by-Step:

#### ✅ 1. **Make Sure You’re Actually Building for Production**

If you’re using **Vite**, React, or similar:

```bash
npm run build
```

Check that it outputs a clean `dist/` folder (or `build/` in CRA). That’s the one Netlify needs to serve.

---

#### ✅ 2. **Ensure `_redirects` is Inside the Final Build Folder**

If your `_redirects` file isn’t getting copied into `dist/`, Netlify **won’t know what to do with dynamic routes**.

**Best way (for Vite or Replit):**

1. Move your `_redirects` file into the `/public` folder
2. Rebuild using:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Confirm that `_redirects` is now inside `dist/`

If it's still missing, add a postbuild step:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build",
  "postbuild": "cp public/_redirects dist/_redirects"
}
```

---

#### ✅ 3. **Deploy `dist/` on Netlify**

When setting up your site on Netlify, set:

* **Build command:** `npm run build`
* **Publish directory:** `dist`

You can also do this from the Netlify UI under **Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Build Settings**

---

#### ✅ 4. **Double-Check Project Structure (ideal)**

Here’s how it should look:

```
/project-root
  /public
    _redirects
    index.html
  /src
    main.js
  vite.config.js
  package.json
```

Then after build:

```
/dist
  index.html
  _redirects
  assets/
```

### 🧪 Final Sanity Test

After doing this:

* Open the live Netlify link
* Try visiting `/events` or `/studios` directly
* It should no longer throw a 404

---

If it *still* breaks, send me:

1. Your `vite.config.js`
2. Folder structure (just a screenshot)
3. Netlify build log (copy the output from the deploy console)

I’ll debug it line-by-line and give you a direct fix.
