Hey Replit,

The Maximally website is currently showing a **completely blank page** when loaded ‚Äî nothing renders. This issue occurred **right after the recent changes** to the footer/nav structure, pages like `/contact`, `/privacy`, and the removal of some footer links.

### üîç Step-by-step: What I need you to do

1. **Inspect the Console for Errors**
   - Open the browser dev tools (or console) and check for any **JavaScript/React errors** being thrown.
   - Common causes could be:
     - Broken route declarations
     - Missing or misnamed component imports
     - Attempting to render a deleted page (like `Resources`, `FAQ`, etc.)
     - Failing to handle `undefined` or `null` props

2. **Check Routing Configuration**
   - Double-check the routes defined in `App.js`, `index.js`, or wherever routing is handled.
   - Ensure that **none of the removed pages** (Guides, Templates, Free Tools, FAQ, Resources, etc.) are still being referenced in the route list or navigation.

3. **Check Navbar/Footer Imports**
   - If the `Footer` or `Navbar` components are referencing a now-deleted page or route, that could crash the whole render.
   - Make sure all `Link` or `NavLink` components only point to valid, existing routes.
   - Validate that conditional rendering logic (like checking for routes or menu items) isn't broken.

4. **Render Fallback**
   - Add a basic fallback view (like a `<h1>Site is loading...</h1>`) to test if the app can load at all.
   - If that doesn't render either, the issue is likely in the top-level `App.js` or `index.js`.

### üßΩ After Fixing It

- Make sure all routes and components are rendering without error.
- The homepage (`/`) should load properly.
- Navbar and footer should both appear on all pages.
- All existing links should redirect to real, working pages.
- Console should be clean ‚Äî no red errors, no warnings if possible.

Once fixed, let me know what the issue was so I can avoid breaking it again later.
