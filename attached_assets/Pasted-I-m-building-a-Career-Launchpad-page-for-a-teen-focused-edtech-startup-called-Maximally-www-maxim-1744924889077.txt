Please turn this into a modern, high-converting landing page targeted at ambitious teens in India. The vibe should be bold, aspirational, yet accessible—not corporate or boring.

✅ Please include:

Hero section with a bold headline, subheading, and a primary CTA (e.g. “Kickstart Your Future”)

Each module should be turned into a Card with an expanded value-based description

Add a “Where You’ll Use This” section (college apps, internships, fellowships, summer schools, etc.)

Add a “Who This Is For” (high schoolers, college students, gap year teens, etc.)

Add a mini FAQ with 3–4 questions about college apps, career planning, relevance, etc.

Use React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (Cards, Buttons, Accordions, etc.)

Keep the layout 100% text-based, clean, with generous spacing and sharp typography

The tone should feel energetic, future-focused, and teen-friendly (avoid jargon or fluff)

Output a complete React component styled appropriately.
