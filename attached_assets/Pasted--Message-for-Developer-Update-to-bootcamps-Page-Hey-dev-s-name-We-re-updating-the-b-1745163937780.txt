**Message for Developer — Update to /bootcamps Page**

Hey [dev's name],

We’re updating the `/bootcamps` page to better explain what students can expect without revealing too much. Here's a breakdown of what to change and where:

---

### ✅ **SECTION: After “📚 Bootcamp Program”**

**Add a new section titled** `🧩 How the Bootcamp *Actually* Works`

Place it *right after the Bootcamp Program (Day 1–7)* and *before the FAQ section*. This section gives a clear picture of how the bootcamp is structured internally.

**Add this full block of text:**

### 🧩 How the Bootcamp *Actually* Works

Maximally is not a class. It’s an experience. Here’s how you’ll learn, build, and grow:

### 🚀 The Format

- 🧠 **7 days. Zero lectures.**
    
    Each afternoon kicks off with a challenge, a guest founder, or a mind-bending activity.
    
- 👥 **Guilds, not groups.**
    
    You’ll be sorted into a guild of 4–5 teens. Think startup team meets secret society. You’ll build together, debate together, and ship real things — every day.
    
- 🎤 **Daily guest speakers.**
    
    Founders, creators, VCs, and domain experts drop in daily. No fluff — just real stories and execution playbooks.
    
- 📦 **Daily deliverables.**
    
    You don’t just learn — you *do*. Build ideas. Design MVPs. Craft pitches. Get feedback. Repeat.
    
- 🧰 **Books + Tools + Videos.**
    
    You’ll get curated mini-reads and videos from legends — stuff you won’t find in textbooks.
    
    (*Think Naval Ravikant, Ali Abdaal, Sahil Bloom, Notion, Figma, ChatGPT.*)
    
- 🧠 **Gamified XP + Leaderboard.**
    
    Complete challenges, win debates, impress mentors — earn XP and badges. Top builders unlock real perks and recognition.
    
- 🎓 **Demo Day Finale.**
    
    On Day 7, your guild will pitch in front of a live panel. No pressure. Just your first real founder moment.

### 🛠️ What You’ll Leave With

✅ A real project (not just theory)

✅ A guild of friends for life

✅ A digital identity you're proud of

✅ Access to the alumni network

✅ Certificate + LOR (for top performers)

✅ Confidence that sticks

### 📝 FAQs: Add These New Questions to Existing FAQ Section

Add the following questions and answers to the current FAQ block:

**Q: What if I’ve never built anything before?**

A: Perfect — we’ll show you how. No experience needed. Just curiosity and willingness to try.

**Q: What’s a “guild”?**

A: A guild is your team of 4–5 students who you’ll work with every day. You’ll brainstorm, debate, and build together — just like a real startup team.

**Q: Will there be homework or assignments?**

A: Yes — but fun ones. Every day ends with a challenge or deliverable to build and share with your guild.

**Q: Will I get to meet speakers and mentors?**

A: Yes — all speaker sessions are live and interactive. You’ll be able to ask questions, join AMAs, and even get shoutouts for good work.

**Q: What happens after the bootcamp ends?**

A: You become part of the Maximally alumni network. That means access to future sessions, internships, mentors, and events — for life.

### 🔧 Other Small Enhancements

1. **Improve spacing and scannability**
    
    Make sure each section has enough padding/margin. Keep emoji bullets consistent (🧠, 🚀, ✅, etc.). Ensure mobile readability.
    
2. **Make “Apply Now” CTA fixed on scroll**
    
    Optional, but consider having a sticky `Apply Now →` button on scroll, especially for mobile.
    
3. **Highlight timeline visually**
    
    Consider turning the “📍 Application Timeline” into a horizontal scroll or stepper format with visual icons if possible (for future UI update).
