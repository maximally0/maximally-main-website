        Got a hobby that you absolutely LIVE for? Maybe it's coding killer game mods, designing awesome graphics, baking cupcakes that taste like heaven, or creating viral Reels dances. What if I told you that awesome thing you do for fun, that spark that makes you light up, could actually become your job?

      <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-4">ðŸ¤” Is Your Passion Project a Business in Disguise?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        First things first, how do you know if your passion has business potential? Not every hobby needs to become a hustle, and that's okay! But if you're feeling that itch, that little voice whispering, "this could be something BIG," then it's time to explore.

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">Identifying the Potential</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Think about what you do and what you create:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8">
        <li>Are people already interested? Do friends ask you to make things for them?</li>
        <li>Does it solve a problem or fill a need?</li>
        <li>Is it scalable? Can you produce more without burning out?</li>
        <li>Do YOU enjoy the idea of doing more of it?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-press-start text-xl mb-4">Step 2: Craft a Simple Business Plan</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your business plan doesn't need to be complex. Focus on:</p>
