3. Fix Footer Temporarily

File Structure: Place the _redirects file in the root directory of the public folder in your project.

For example, ensure a rule for 404 handling and any necessary page redirects:

bash
Copy
Edit
/old-url   /new-url   301
/*          /index.html  200
5. Start SEO Optimization

Meta Tags: Add meta tags to each page for better visibility and indexing:

Title: Relevant and keyword-rich.

Description: A concise summary with keywords related to the services you offer.

Keywords: Add keywords that represent the business, like “Entrepreneurship for teens,” “Digital marketing for students,” “Public speaking bootcamps,” etc.

Alt Text for Images: If there are any images, make sure they have descriptive alt text for SEO purposes.

Headings (H1, H2, H3): Ensure that each page is using proper heading hierarchy (H1 for main title, H2 for subsections, etc.).

Internal Linking: Link to relevant pages within your website (e.g., from the About page to the Community page).
