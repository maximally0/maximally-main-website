I want you to redesign this as a compelling landing page targeted at ambitious high-schoolers and college teens in India. The goal is to make it inspiring, modern, and easy to read with clear value.

✅ Things to include:

Hero section with bold headline, subheading, and CTA

Each module should have a short paragraph or value-focused teaser beneath it (not just one-liners)

Add a “What You’ll Learn” or “Outcomes” section (e.g., build your own Instagram strategy, run mock ad campaigns, etc.)

Add “Who This Is For” (aspiring content creators, marketers, startup founders)

Add a mini FAQ (3–4 items)

Design should use React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components (Cards, CTA buttons, Accordions, etc.)

Stick to a text-based layout (no images or media), generous padding, soft shadows, rounded cards, modern SaaS feel

Typography should feel bold, accessible, teen-friendly, but clean

Avoid filler—be specific about the skills teens will gain

Output the complete React component code styled appropriately. Don’t include imports for images or icons. This is part of a bigger educational bootcamp platform called “Maximally” teaching teens real-world skills.
