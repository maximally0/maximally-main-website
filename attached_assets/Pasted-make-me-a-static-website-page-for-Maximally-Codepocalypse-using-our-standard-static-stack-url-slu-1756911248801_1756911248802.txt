what it is

copy: a chaotic 48-hour hackathon where the only rule is to ship something wild. broken prototypes, cursed ideas, internet-core genius — all collide here. no themes, no prep. just code, crash, and deploy.

the idea

copy: this event asks one question — what would you build if you had 48 hours before the internet exploded? codepocalypse is a love letter to bizarre, ambitious, half-baked builds. no neat slides. no neat stacks. just mayhem and maybe magic.
