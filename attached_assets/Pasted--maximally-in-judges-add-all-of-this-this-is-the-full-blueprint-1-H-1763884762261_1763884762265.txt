*(add all of this — this is the full blueprint)*

---

## **1. Hero Section (you already have most of this)**

- big bold headline
- strong subhead
- “Apply to be a Judge” button
- “View Verified Judges” link

## **3. The Judge Level System (New Section)**

A short intro paragraph:

> “Maximally uses a 5-level judging framework — the world’s first standardized hierarchy for innovation evaluation.
> 
> 
> Your level reflects your expertise, experience, and contribution to the ecosystem.
> 
> Everyone starts at a home level, and can rise through the ranks over time.”
> 

then list the 5 levels:

- Level 1: Starter Judge
- Level 2: Verified Judge
- Level 3: Senior Judge
- Level 4: Chief Judge
- Level 5: Legacy Judge

---

## **4. Criteria For Each Level (New + crucial)**

Add a subheading:

### **Judge Level Criteria**

then create a mini-card for each level with:

- **Who this is for**
- **What we look for**
- **Typical profile examples**
- **What they can judge in Maximally**

this is super important because people will self-identify instantly.

(I’ve already written all these for you above — just paste them.)

### **Review Cycle**

> 

---

## **6. Fast Track Eligibility (New Section)**

This tells high-level people they won’t be put in Level 1.

Add:

    - staff engineers, founders, seasoned mentors
- **Fast-track to Level 4**
    - directors, VPs, CTOs, senior academics
- **Direct Legacy Level**
    - exceptional global figures with ecosystem impact
    - invite-only or special evaluation

One line:

> "If your profile demonstrates exceptional credibility, we place you directly into the level you deserve — no need to climb from Level 1."

# ⚡ Additional extras (very good ideas you can add)

## **A. “Judge Season Badges”**

like:

- MGIHS 2025
- PromptStorm Alpha Judge
- Codepocalypse Winter Judge

collectible. feels premium.

## **B. “Inactive Status”**

If a judge doesn’t judge for 2 seasons → mark them inactive.

Still keeps credibility but explains silence.
